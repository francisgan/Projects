"Hi SudhansuRegarding imputing missing NAs .. this was one of the first things I addressed. If I recall the percentage of missing data ranged from 1.5% to over 80% depending on the potential predictor in question. Since I am interested in the pricing variables, I choose early to not drop these data, and instead came up with a particular strategy for imputation. (Frankly, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll get better performance from my models, if I did drop the pricing variables, but the originally stated problem was to investigate the impact of pricing, so they stayed). I note from your comment a question as to whether imputation can be justified. The question come down to whether you would have confidence in &#8220;finding&#8221; the missing values. Prof Rowe suggest that Non-Disclose Agreements are a possible reasoning to why prices are &#8216;missing&#8217;. This then is a known mechanism, suggesting that the data is not missing completely at random (what the experts would call MCAR). Nor does it suggest that the data are Missing not at Random (in expert lingo: MNAR). Given both of these assessments, I took that as justification for imputing a large number of missing values. There are various methodologies that you can employ to help with imputation. If I had more time, I would experiment with the various imputation methodologies, but since I am pressed for time, I will stick to the strategy that I employed. I&#8217;m impressed with the OLS results you got with two predictors &#8230; did the diagnostics on the regression show any concern with modelling via linear regression?Again - best of luck with your work.","Turn this into a short, catchy slogan."," Missing data imputation was a key issue addressed in the text, and the author decided to impute a large number of missing values due to the nature of the data and the specific problem being investigated."

"I think you're right about diversity. It could be the case that the model with the highest CV is very similar to other models, so the similar models split the weight.For example, imagine that we have a total of 4 models and models 1, 2, 3 are basically the same while 4 is very unique. Also imagine that models 1, 2, 3 each have CV 0.935 while model 4 has CV 0.925. Then the final weights may be 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.4 respectively.So model's 1, 2, 3 got a combined 0.6 and they are all the same while model 4 got 0.4. When you look at the weights individually, model 4 got the most. But when you group them together by similarity, then the group 1,2,3 got the most.",Describe this as a headline., Model Similarity Can Lead to Unequal Weight Distribution Despite High CV Scores

"One way is to generate point forecasts for the next 28 days of the training data, then calculate the Scaled Pinball Loss with different coefficients for different levels.With that said, I would not optimise the coefficients. Despite the promising LB scores, this approach (point forecasts multiplied by some numbers) is likely suboptimal. For instance, one of the disadvantages here is the symmetry of the intervals (if Quantile q is (1-x) * point_forecast, Quantile 1-q is always (1+x) * point_forecast).Honestly, I see this more like something that helps achieving a good score early on (in other words: without much effort), but in the long run, directly predicting quantiles with a proper loss function should prevail.",Craft a haiku that captures the essence of this text:,

"For number plate recognition, consider using a two-step approach: First, detect the license plate region in the image using object detection models like SSD or YOLO. Once the region is detected, use optical character recognition (OCR) models, possibly fine-tuned on license plate data, to extract the alphanumeric characters.For street sign recognition, again, you can adopt a two-step process: detection followed by classification. Use object detection models to identify and locate the street signs in the image. After detecting the signs, a classification model can identify the type or category of each sign.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown impressive results in both tasks. Leveraging pre-trained models on large datasets and fine-tuning them on your specific data can expedite the training process and improve accuracy.",Write this as a diary entry from someone experiencing the events firsthand.,"For number plate and street sign recognition, I'm trying to implement a system that can read and classify them from images.

"Another note to Jeff:
when I said close to draw I did not do it by having a rule to change the expected result to be closer to draw but by changing the future rating of a player.
The idea is that if a player played against many opponents and the average of the opponents are significantly stronger than him I increase his rating.
The increase in rating means closer to draw result in most cases so I translated it in my post to closer to draw result but of course it can lead also to closer to win results for minority of the cases and if A with rating 2000 played against&nbsp;6 players with
 rating 2200 and one&nbsp;player with rating 1800 then it means that A's rating is going up and his expected result against the 1800 players is closer to win.",Exclaim as a sudden realization.,"The key idea is that if a player plays against many opponents whose average rating is significantly higher than their own, their rating increases.

"ColumnsLet's start by breaking down the meaning of each column in the dataset:    Mean_Integrated: This is the mean integrated pulse profile, which measures the average intensity of a pulsar's signal over a period of time.  SD: This is the standard deviation of the integrated pulse profile, which measures the degree of variation in the intensity of the pulsar's signal.  EK: This is the excess kurtosis of the integrated pulse profile, which measures the ""peakedness"" of the distribution of intensities.  Skewness: This measures the degree of asymmetry in the distribution of intensities in the integrated pulse profile.  Mean_DMSNR_Curve: This is the mean of the curve of the integrated pulse profile's signal-to-noise ratio as a function of time.  SD_DMSNR_Curve: This is the standard deviation of the curve of the integrated pulse profile's signal-to-noise ratio as a function of time.  EK_DMSNR_Curve: This is the excess kurtosis of the curve of the integrated pulse profile's signal-to-noise ratio as a function of time.  Skewness_DMSNR_Curve: This measures the degree of asymmetry in the curve of the integrated pulse profile's signal-to-noise ratio as a function of time.  Feature Ideas    Frequency domain features: One possible set of features to engineer would be based on the Fourier transform of the integrated pulse profile. This could include features such as the frequency of the peak intensity, the width of the peak, or the presence of harmonics.  Time domain features: Another set of features could be based on the autocorrelation function of the integrated pulse profile. This could include features such as the width of the autocorrelation function, or the time at which the autocorrelation function crosses a certain threshold.  Multi-scale features: It may be useful to compute features at different scales or resolutions, such as by dividing the integrated pulse profile into segments of different lengths.  Statistical features: Additional statistical features could be computed, such as higher-order moments (e.g., fourth or sixth moment) or the presence of outliers.  Domain-specific features: Depending on the domain knowledge available, it may be useful to engineer features that capture specific aspects of pulsars, such as their rotation or the geometry of their magnetic fields.  I haven't gotten very deep in my analysis. Please comment if you have anything to add! Good luck on this competition!",Mimic the style of a famous author to retell this information:,These columns offer valuable insights into the overall characteristics of the pulsar's behavior.The mean integrated pulse profile measures the average intensity of the pulsar's signal over a particular time interval.
