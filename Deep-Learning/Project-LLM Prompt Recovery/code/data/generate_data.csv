Here are a few options:Ignore the rows with missing values: This is only a viable option if the number of rows with missing values is small compared to the total number of rows.Impute the missing values: This involves replacing the missing values with some other value, such as the mode (most frequent value) of the variable. This is a quick and easy option, but it may not always produce the best results.Use a separate category for missing values: This involves creating a new category specifically for missing values. This can be useful if the missing values have some meaningful interpretation.Use multiple imputations: This involves using advanced techniques to impute the missing values in a way that takes into account the uncertainty associated with the imputation. Multiple imputations can produce more accurate results than simple imputation, but it is also more complex and time-consuming.Which option you choose will depend on the nature of your data and the goals of your analysis.",Express this as an inspirational quote.,"Missing values in categorical variables can be handled in several ways.

Valeriy Babushkin (VENHEADs)Valery used custom-built U-Net based on keras framework with different optimizers (Adam, RMSProb, SGD).Due to the limited batch size that can be fitted on one GPU he replaced BatchNorm layer with renormaliztion one.Artur Kuzin (n01z3)My solution is based on mxnet.In my opinion, it was crucial to use some multi-GPU framework what mxnet fits and the latter is also fast enough what is the bonus.However the deconvolution layer in mxnet realization is rather strange therefore I wasn‚Äôt able to reproduce the LinkNet architecture straight from the articleand had to invent something to fit the layers‚Äô shapes from hairy resnet graph.Nevertheless in spite of all the tricks (custom loss, different optimizers, hard negative sampling) had been done,I haven‚Äôt succeeded with training models to the heights on a par with my teammates‚Äô models.Evgeny Nizhibitsky (nizhib)Evgeny made the best models of our ensemble with pytorch.After digging into and translating some arXiv articlesinto the code, he've discovered that LinkNet does very well in this competition.Thus he decided to create some mutated forms of LinkNet using other architectures as an encoder.As a result we've got ""incnet"" ‚Äî inception-v3 + linknet decoders and ""dinknet"" ‚Äî densenet +the same decoders.

159,"As you know, this contest was restarted because some data leakage was found in the first release of the dataset. &nbsp;Now that the contest is over, I‚Äôd like to talk a bit about that leakage; l think the technical details are interesting, and they might make for an interesting case study.I found that it was possible to get an 0.9973 AUC using only leakage,without&nbsp;reading the audio files we were given. &nbsp;For a brief moment, that put my team (‚ÄúLeaky Larry‚Äù) &nbsp;on top of theleaderboard&nbsp;and ahead of legitimate teams that created the top algorithms in the first Whale Detection Challenge. &nbsp;Leakage can, of course, undermine the credibility of the leaderboard scores. In the first week of the contest, I gave Kaggle the details about the leakage I found. &nbsp;Cornell / Marineexplore then promptly revised the dataset, and then the competition was restarted. &nbsp;The revision fixed most of the issue, and the algorithm that got 0.9973 on the original dataset (using only leakage) could only achieve a 0.59 AUC on the revised dataset.The leakage came from three sources:The distribution of file lengths (in bytes) The &nbsp;timestamp embedded in the audio clip filename (focusing mostly on the millisecond field)The chronological order of the clips (ordered using the full timestamp) &nbsp;File SizesAfter downloading the data and typing a simple ‚Äúls -lS‚Äù, I noticed that a large number of &nbsp;audio clip files had both the same size and the same label (i.e. whale vs no-whale). &nbsp;Interestingly, fIles with the same size were not duplicates (their md5sums differed). &nbsp;This seemed fishy.To &nbsp;investigate further, I made histograms of the file sizes, broken down by label. &nbsp;Audio files with whale upcalls turned out to have a very specific set of file sizes (see this ‚Äúcomb-like‚Äùhistogram&nbsp;&nbsp;where some files are multiples of 148 bytes plus a constant). &nbsp;In contrast, files without whale upcalls had sizes that looked &nbsp;much more evenly distributed (see this&nbsp;histogram).&nbsp;Thus, certain file sizes provided a strong indication that a clip had a whale upcall in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;Also, files with whale upcalls were larger, on average. &nbsp;Millisecond timestampsAnother anomaly was related to the timestamps embedded in the filenames. &nbsp;If a whale upcall was not in a file, the millisecond field in the timestamp was almost always a multiple of 10 ms &nbsp;(seethis).&nbsp;However, if a whale upcall was in a file, the millisecond field seemed evenly distributed in time - i.e. multiples of 1 ms (seethis). &nbsp;Thus, a zero in the last digit of the millisecond field was strongly predictive; using a simple test for zero as a binary feature yielded a 0.945 AUC by itself.Next, additional histograms of the millisecond timestamps showed that the audio clips without whale upcalls were more likely to start in the first half of a given second &nbsp;(seethis).&nbsp;Clips with whale upcalls were more evenly distributed across time (seethis).Putting these observations together, it seems like the audio clips with upcalls were processed in a different way than those without upcalls. &nbsp;As a competitor, though, &nbsp;it‚Äôs impossible to tell what the true root causes of these differences were, or if they could be useful.Clip orderin the first Whale Detection challenge, the (chronological) ordering of the clips contained information. The same was true in this contest. &nbsp;A moving average of clip labels in the training set showed a familiar pattern: minutes or hours of high whale-call activity, followed by equally lengthy lulls &nbsp;(see this). &nbsp;A moving average could be used to capture some of this serial correlation in the leaked test clip labels, providing a ‚Äútemporally local‚Äù probability of a whale upcall.FeaturesTo take advantage of all these observations, &nbsp;I created the following features:File size in bytes (as an integer) File size in bytes (as a categorical variable). Timestamp_milliseconds (as an integer) 0 if timestamp_milliseconds was a multiple of 10, 1 otherwise 0 if timestamp_milliseconds was a multiple of 10, moving average of the above 0/1 feature otherwiseA logistic regression using these simple features yielded 0.9973 AUC on the leaderboard. &nbsp;I used the ‚Äòglmnet‚Äô package in R for logistic regression, and python to create the features.FixesCornell corrected these anomalies by:Capping the file size so that most files were exactly 2 seconds long (8088 bytes).Reducing the millisecond field in the filename timestamp from 3 digits down to 1 (though what that 1 digit represents is unclear).I think it‚Äôs easy to see how these slight anomalies could go unnoticed, though some turned out to be unexpectedly effective predictors. Even if competitors didn‚Äôt notice these these anomalies, it‚Äôs possible that some algorithms might have silently picked up on them if they weren‚Äôt corrected.Like software bugs, leakage seems hard to avoid entirely. I applaud Kaggle &amp; Cornell for swiftly fixing these issues once they were found.",Explain this to me like I'm five.,"The contest was restarted because there was data leakage in the first release of the dataset.

Text converted to [0-9a-z &amp;] with unidecodeAlso, since there were many nans for the address, we complemented by connecting three neighborhoods of the distance.Processing for each languageBasically, all languages ‚Äã‚Äãhave uniform removal of symbols-&gt; lowercase letters / digitization of numbers-&gt; alphabetization.Since Japanese, Chinese, and Thai are languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat require word-separation, they are processed individually.For Japanese, use the tokenizer Sudachi to get the word-separation and reading, and then use Pykakasi to convert it to romaji. did.Chinese was divided by zh_segmehntation and converted to romaji by unidecode.Thai is divided and romanized using PyThaiNLP.city, state pre-processingFor city and state, we took out about 2000 in order of the number of appearances and put them in the category of fitting to any of 2000 in the vicinity of the distance.We also converted it to the top 2000 place names using the cities1000 dataset and made it into a category. (Hereafter referred to as geo_name)Creating an embeddingFor the text of 3 in the previous section, the name and address were divided into 32000 subwords using different sentence pieces.On top of this, we learned embedding by the following three unsupervised pre-learning based on word2vec.About name Skip-gram taskTask to predict categories from name, address, city, state, geo_nameA contrasting learning task that mixes name, address, city, state, geo_name, categories and guesses itself by SimCSEWhen doing these learnings, the method of obtaining negative samples was very important.We were able to perform high-quality learning by generating a negative sample with a random walk for each sample, using the probability based on the negative logarithm of the hadsine distance as the edge for the vicinity of 128 of each sample.Fill in missing values ‚Äã‚Äãin a categoryNow that we have a good model for category prediction, we filled in the missing values ‚Äã‚Äãby making predictions for those with blank categories.Clustering / one-dimensionalEach embedding was divided into about 2000 clusters by spherical kmmeans ++.We also implemented kmeans ++ based on the hadsine distance and divided it into about 2000 clusters as well.After splitting the cluster, we embedded the information in one dimension by solving the traveling salesman problem for the distance between each vertex.This is a technique called Word Tour, which allows you to transform embedding into a form that GBDT can easily interpret in just one dimension.Each category was sorted by TSP based on the similarity of each kmeans, the similarity of names and addresses with the number of occurrences top2000, and the haversine distances of city, state, and geoname, and used as continuous values.Feature generationhaversine distanceThe logarithm of the distance between two points was taken and used as a feature.

Measure the degree of agreement between sentences and give precision, recall, f1 value.ROUGE-N was compared using N-GRAM, ROUGE-L was compared using LCS, the former was implemented using tensorflow's Ragged Tensor, and the latter was implemented using tensorflow-text's rouge_l function.Cosine similarity, one-dimensional distanceFor each embedding, the cosine similarity and the distance after dropping to one dimension are added as features.city / stateSimilar to embedding, the top 2000 cities and states are listed as features in the order of Count Encoding and traveling salesman problem.categoriesI also got the category embedding by doing metric learning about the category prediction task during pre-learning.Like the other features, the category embedding is based on the count encoding as the features arranged in the traveling salesman problem.phone / urlOnly whether or not they match after normalization was added as a feature quantity.Candidate generationCandidate generation for learning and prediction combines multiple logics.haversine 4 nearest neighbors of distanceHaversine 12 multiple regressions of distance logarithm and embedding cosine similarity such as name, address, categories, etc.About name Similarity by rouge-1 in word unit, precision, recall Total 4About name A total of 8 similarities, precision, and recall by rouge-2 in character unitsTop 4 cosine similarity of namepredictI used LightGBM. 2000 iterations training was performed on all data without early stopping, and GPU prediction was performed by Forest Inference at the time of prediction.The hyperparameters are as follows, and max_bin has been increased only for some categories.max_bin_by_feature = []for col in feature_cols:    if (col.endswith (""kmeans_labels"") or col.endswith (""pos_tsp_index"")) and col.startswith (""query""):        print (col)        max_bin_by_feature.append (255 * 4)    elif (col.endswith (""kmeans_labels"") or col.endswith (""pos_tsp_index"")) and col.startswith (""candidate""):        print (col)        max_bin_by_feature.append (255 * 2)    elif col.endswith (""_category_frequent_min_tsp"") or col.endswith (""_category_frequent_max_tsp""):        print (col)        max_bin_by_feature.append (255 * 2)    else: else:        max_bin_by_feature.append (255)lgb_params = {    ""objective"": ""binary"",    ""metric"": ""auc"",    ""boosting"":'gbdt',    ""max_depth"": -1, -1,    ""num_leaves"": 2 ** 12 --1,    ""learning_rate"": 0.1,    ""bagging_freq"": 1,    ""is_unbalance"": True,    ""max_bin_by_feature"": max_bin_by_feature,     ""bin_construct_sample_cnt"": 200000,    ""lambda_l1"": 1.,    ""lambda_l2"": 1.,    ""bagging_fraction"": 0.9,    ""feature_fraction"": 0.6,    ""seed"": 0}Post-processingThe graph was constructed for each group by UnionFind after removing some edges based on the mediation centrality of the graph, with the predicted values ‚Äã‚Äãof the pair being above a certain level.For each group, the shortest distance to all pairs of unweighted graphs was calculated, and the predicted value was within 256 vertices within 2 distances from each vertex.",Recapitulate this as a jazz song lyric.,"The text is well-written and easy to understand.

This seems like it would cause arbitrary issues with capturing the full call or song sequences. What is the reasoning for not doing analysis on the spectrogram of the full audio clip?I have at least one guess for why we need to chop into chunks:      Images may be different sizes due to differing lengths or the patterns will get distorted if we try to make all the images the same size.

309,"Hi @imadali595,Awesome work on this notebook.I have a few suggestions for things you could add to make it even better:Check your ROC curves:Beside the metrics you check, I would suggest plotting the ROC curve because it is a useful tool for better understanding your model performance under different thresholds. You can use this: from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, plot_roc_curveUse cross-validation:While splitting your data into train and test sets is an important step in the machine learning pipeline, it is not enough to ensure that your model generalizes well to unseen data. I suggest using cross-validation to evaluate your model's performance. You can use cross_val_score from sklearn.model_selection to calculate the average accuracy of your model across multiple folds. This way, you can be more confident that your model is not overfitting to the training set and is generalizing well to new data.Nonlinear Models:It might be worth trying out some non-linear models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) as they may be able to achieve better results by capturing complex and deeper relationships in the data. Most models today have the same interface to it is easy to try out different models.Consider using KDE instead of histograms:While your histogram plot is informative, it can be improved by using a kernel density estimate (KDE) plot instead of a histogram. KDE is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. It is smoother than a histogram and provides a better estimate of the underlying distribution. You can use seaborn package to create a KDE plot.  seaborn  snsfigure = plt.figure(figsize=(, ))sns.kdeplot(train[train[] == ][], shade=, label=)sns.kdeplot(train[train[] == ][], shade=, label=)Normalize The Data:I suggest normalizing the data before fitting the model. While some models will not benfit from this, others will (and it is also easy to check and see..). It can be essential to normalize / scale (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler) for equally representing all features.Optimize Hyperparameters:You can easily improve your model by tuning the hyperparameters. One approach is to use validation and simply try different values and combinations. (Grid search: GridSearchCV example)Have a great day!

Ex: Using the kernel by @suicaokhoailangSearching Past Competitions for similar traces/ideas: Ex: My Teammate @pnvijay found MAP Code in an older kernel Running constant experiments based on public kernels and going forth with the ones that are showing an increased score. Having a good local validation and cross checking if it works by comparing our estimates against the public LB. Long Term Startegy: Aiming for a medal, making a submission and trying to maintaing the position achieved on the LB in the future. Do you think this is a good plan? My main question is what happens once I've done all experiments with fastai. For ex, the lib supports ResNet34,50,101,152. What should we consider doing once our experiments with these are over?

835,"Thanks to the organizers for hosting the interesting competition and congratulations to all the winners. It was tough, but was a great experience for me.DatasetsThree Yolov5 models are trained to detect fullbody and backfin, respectively.Scores improved greatly with changing datasets as: original image -&gt; detic crop -&gt; fullbody crop -&gt; fullbody/backfin crop.ModelsArcFace models are trained using fullbody crop (640√ó640) and backfin crop (448√ó448), respectively. The parameters of ArcFace are set as scale = 25 and margin = 0.5 (The large margin worked with improved datasets in my case). Embedding size is 2048.Focal loss for species classification (loss weight = 0.1) is also used.Backbone: Efficientnet-b7 and ConvNeXt-LIn order to make embeddings more discriminative, multiply the feature maps by the attention weights computed with GAP features as a query. This worked only with Efficientnet.Pseudo labeling: Take about 30% top predictions (would be better to use more data and multiple iterations).Distillation: Use the features of the teacher model as soft target and compute MSE. This greatly improves the performance in the early stages of training, but the contribution to the final score does not seem to be that large, so adopt cosine schedule to set the final loss weight to 0.AugmentationAverage blur, motion blur, gaussian noise, saturation, brightness, contrast, grayscale and affine transform (flip, rotation, shear, scaling and translation) are used.Training detailsHyper parameters: AdamW with weight decay = 0.05, base lr = 2e-4, cosine scheduling with linear warmup, batch size = 24 along with gradient accumulationPyTorch is used and training 30 epochs with a single A100 GPU take about 30 hours for a fullbody model and 15 hours for a backfin model.Private LB of the best single fullbody model is 0.781.Post-processCosine similarity matrix for the individuals is computed using the features of the test images and ArcFace weights using each model.Then average the matrices to ensemble eight fullbody/backfiin models.Insert new_individual with a fixed threshold (should have changed threshold for each species).Finally, switch adjacent top predictions based on the difference of cosine similarity and the degree of assignment to the top for class balancing.What did not workThe following did not work in my case.ElasticfaceMagfaceSetting sample-wise margin based on the magnitude of lossesTriplet lossSemi-supervised learning with self-distillation loss of DINO (somewhat worked, but employed pseudo-labeling)Adding a SOD mask channel to inputAdding an attention weight channel to inputThank you for reading.",Report this as a scientific discovery that revolutionizes our understanding of the cosmos and our place within it.,"The text you provided describes a scientific discovery that revolutionizes our understanding of the cosmos and our place within it.

947,"Hi @imadali595,Awesome work on this notebook.I have a few suggestions for things you could add to make it even better:Check your ROC curves:Beside the metrics you check, I would suggest plotting the ROC curve because it is a useful tool for better understanding your model performance under different thresholds. You can use this: from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, plot_roc_curveUse cross-validation:While splitting your data into train and test sets is an important step in the machine learning pipeline, it is not enough to ensure that your model generalizes well to unseen data. I suggest using cross-validation to evaluate your model's performance. You can use cross_val_score from sklearn.model_selection to calculate the average accuracy of your model across multiple folds. This way, you can be more confident that your model is not overfitting to the training set and is generalizing well to new data.Nonlinear Models:It might be worth trying out some non-linear models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) as they may be able to achieve better results by capturing complex and deeper relationships in the data. Most models today have the same interface to it is easy to try out different models.Consider using KDE instead of histograms:While your histogram plot is informative, it can be improved by using a kernel density estimate (KDE) plot instead of a histogram. KDE is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. It is smoother than a histogram and provides a better estimate of the underlying distribution. You can use seaborn package to create a KDE plot.  seaborn  snsfigure = plt.figure(figsize=(, ))sns.kdeplot(train[train[] == ][], shade=, label=)sns.kdeplot(train[train[] == ][], shade=, label=)Normalize The Data:I suggest normalizing the data before fitting the model. While some models will not benfit from this, others will (and it is also easy to check and see..). It can be essential to normalize / scale (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler) for equally representing all features.Optimize Hyperparameters:You can easily improve your model by tuning the hyperparameters. One approach is to use validation and simply try different values and combinations. (Grid search: GridSearchCV example)Have a great day!

966,"As you know, this contest was restarted because some data leakage was found in the first release of the dataset. &nbsp;Now that the contest is over, I‚Äôd like to talk a bit about that leakage; l think the technical details are interesting, and they might make for an interesting case study.I found that it was possible to get an 0.9973 AUC using only leakage,without&nbsp;reading the audio files we were given. &nbsp;For a brief moment, that put my team (‚ÄúLeaky Larry‚Äù) &nbsp;on top of theleaderboard&nbsp;and ahead of legitimate teams that created the top algorithms in the first Whale Detection Challenge. &nbsp;Leakage can, of course, undermine the credibility of the leaderboard scores. In the first week of the contest, I gave Kaggle the details about the leakage I found. &nbsp;Cornell / Marineexplore then promptly revised the dataset, and then the competition was restarted. &nbsp;The revision fixed most of the issue, and the algorithm that got 0.9973 on the original dataset (using only leakage) could only achieve a 0.59 AUC on the revised dataset.The leakage came from three sources:The distribution of file lengths (in bytes) The &nbsp;timestamp embedded in the audio clip filename (focusing mostly on the millisecond field)The chronological order of the clips (ordered using the full timestamp) &nbsp;File SizesAfter downloading the data and typing a simple ‚Äúls -lS‚Äù, I noticed that a large number of &nbsp;audio clip files had both the same size and the same label (i.e. whale vs no-whale). &nbsp;Interestingly, fIles with the same size were not duplicates (their md5sums differed). &nbsp;This seemed fishy.To &nbsp;investigate further, I made histograms of the file sizes, broken down by label. &nbsp;Audio files with whale upcalls turned out to have a very specific set of file sizes (see this ‚Äúcomb-like‚Äùhistogram&nbsp;&nbsp;where some files are multiples of 148 bytes plus a constant). &nbsp;In contrast, files without whale upcalls had sizes that looked &nbsp;much more evenly distributed (see this&nbsp;histogram).&nbsp;Thus, certain file sizes provided a strong indication that a clip had a whale upcall in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;Also, files with whale upcalls were larger, on average. &nbsp;Millisecond timestampsAnother anomaly was related to the timestamps embedded in the filenames. &nbsp;If a whale upcall was not in a file, the millisecond field in the timestamp was almost always a multiple of 10 ms &nbsp;(seethis).&nbsp;However, if a whale upcall was in a file, the millisecond field seemed evenly distributed in time - i.e. multiples of 1 ms (seethis). &nbsp;Thus, a zero in the last digit of the millisecond field was strongly predictive; using a simple test for zero as a binary feature yielded a 0.945 AUC by itself.Next, additional histograms of the millisecond timestamps showed that the audio clips without whale upcalls were more likely to start in the first half of a given second &nbsp;(seethis).&nbsp;Clips with whale upcalls were more evenly distributed across time (seethis).Putting these observations together, it seems like the audio clips with upcalls were processed in a different way than those without upcalls. &nbsp;As a competitor, though, &nbsp;it‚Äôs impossible to tell what the true root causes of these differences were, or if they could be useful.Clip orderin the first Whale Detection challenge, the (chronological) ordering of the clips contained information. The same was true in this contest. &nbsp;A moving average of clip labels in the training set showed a familiar pattern: minutes or hours of high whale-call activity, followed by equally lengthy lulls &nbsp;(see this). &nbsp;A moving average could be used to capture some of this serial correlation in the leaked test clip labels, providing a ‚Äútemporally local‚Äù probability of a whale upcall.FeaturesTo take advantage of all these observations, &nbsp;I created the following features:File size in bytes (as an integer) File size in bytes (as a categorical variable). Timestamp_milliseconds (as an integer) 0 if timestamp_milliseconds was a multiple of 10, 1 otherwise 0 if timestamp_milliseconds was a multiple of 10, moving average of the above 0/1 feature otherwiseA logistic regression using these simple features yielded 0.9973 AUC on the leaderboard. &nbsp;I used the ‚Äòglmnet‚Äô package in R for logistic regression, and python to create the features.FixesCornell corrected these anomalies by:Capping the file size so that most files were exactly 2 seconds long (8088 bytes).Reducing the millisecond field in the filename timestamp from 3 digits down to 1 (though what that 1 digit represents is unclear).I think it‚Äôs easy to see how these slight anomalies could go unnoticed, though some turned out to be unexpectedly effective predictors. Even if competitors didn‚Äôt notice these these anomalies, it‚Äôs possible that some algorithms might have silently picked up on them if they weren‚Äôt corrected.Like software bugs, leakage seems hard to avoid entirely.

Synthetic means that which is produced by synthesis, combining parts to form a whole; colloquially, a human-made version of that which has arisen naturally. A ""synthetic intelligence"" would therefore be or appear human-made, but not a simulation.The term was used by Haugeland in 1986 to describe artificial intelligence research up to that point, which he called ""good old fashioned artificial intelligence"" or ""GOFAI"". AI's first generation of researchers firmly believed their techniques would lead to real, human-like intelligence in machines. After the first AI winter, many AI researchers shifted their focus from artificial general intelligence to finding solutions for specific individual problems, such as machine learning, an approach to which some popular sources refer as ""weak AI"" or ""applied AI.""The term ""synthetic AI"" is now sometimes used by researchers in the field to separate their work (using subsymbolism, emergence, Psi-Theory, or other relatively new methods to define and create ""true"" intelligence) from previous attempts, particularly those of GOFAI or weak AI.Sources disagree about exactly what constitutes ""real"" intelligence as opposed to ""simulated"" intelligence and therefore whether there is a meaningful distinction between artificial intelligence and synthetic intelligence.(c) What Is AI? ‚Äì An introduction to artificial intelligence by John McCarthy‚Äîa co-founder of the field, and the person who coined the term.",Refashion this as a show-stopping revelation.,"Synthetic intelligence (SI) is a show-stopping revelation, a genuine form of intelligence that emphasizes that machines can be genuinely intelligent, not just simulations of human intelligence.

1266,"Hi!(Bagging) Bootstrap aggregating and boosting are examples of ensembles. An ensemble is the use of several different models in order to increase the quality of the predictions. Why do we use ensembles? Because they improve the quality of our predictions. Why do they increase the quality of our predictions? And that depends on the particular ensemble. In general, we can cite heuristics as well - it's better to ask several different experts and average their answer.Now about the algorithms themselves.Bagging. The algorithm implies building N trees, and the sample for each new tree is sampled from the whole set of objects with repeat (that's why it is a bootstrap). Features are also sampled, that is, each tree sees only a subsample of objects and a subsample of features. Each tree then predicts and the final answer is averaged. The most famous implamentation is sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestBoosting. In contrast to the previous example, in boosting the value of models in the ensemble is unequal. Trees are constructed sequentially so as to reduce the error on each sample object. The most popular type of boosting is gradient boosting. It should be noted that at the moment gradient boostings are the kings of tabular data and show the best results (they are also times faster than neural networks).

1321,"Hi!(Bagging) Bootstrap aggregating and boosting are examples of ensembles. An ensemble is the use of several different models in order to increase the quality of the predictions. Why do we use ensembles? Because they improve the quality of our predictions. Why do they increase the quality of our predictions? And that depends on the particular ensemble. In general, we can cite heuristics as well - it's better to ask several different experts and average their answer.Now about the algorithms themselves.Bagging. The algorithm implies building N trees, and the sample for each new tree is sampled from the whole set of objects with repeat (that's why it is a bootstrap). Features are also sampled, that is, each tree sees only a subsample of objects and a subsample of features. Each tree then predicts and the final answer is averaged. The most famous implamentation is sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestBoosting. In contrast to the previous example, in boosting the value of models in the ensemble is unequal. Trees are constructed sequentially so as to reduce the error on each sample object. The most popular type of boosting is gradient boosting. It should be noted that at the moment gradient boostings are the kings of tabular data and show the best results (they are also times faster than neural networks). The most popular implementations of gradient booing: xgboost, catboost, lightgbmhope my answer was helpful :3Good luck in development, be happy in 2023 ",Frame this as a debate between two sides.,"**The text describes the concept of ensembles and two popular algorithms: bagging and boosting.**Bagging*** Uses multiple trees, each trained on a bootstrap sample of the training data.* Features are also sampled, leading to diversity among trees.* Final predictions are averaged to improve accuracy.**Boosting*** Trees are constructed sequentially, reducing error on each sample object.* Unequal weighting of models in the ensemble."

As for that, I have a few thoughts about what properties a good selection strategy should have:It should be fast at adapting to the opponentBecause the matches are so random, it should base its decision not only on a handful of observationsIt should be quite random so that it does not expose detectable patterns in the underlying agentsBased on those thoughts I came up with the strategy of first selecting a group of agents which performed well for some amount of time and then selecting a final agent out of this group based on its performance during the last few moves. Finally, the scores of the agents are not deterministic but drawn from a distribution, this way I introduce some randomness.

Plus you were one of the few who kept alive the almost desert forums.About votes in this competition, I think there was some distortion because of the competition format. There are many kernels that possibly under ""normal"" circumstances would have had some votes that are almost unnoticed (Funnily, I had not even read the elegant solution of @awainger before winners were announced. 135 kernels are a lot...)About actual optimal format of presentation... who knows. I agree that it would be good to have more clear guidelines, or even a template,so that efforts can be better directed. But in almost all Kaggle competition I've taken part in there's noise and some degree of surprises...I find a huge problem the fact that kernels can not be shared before and can not be digested after... Maybe too pesimistic but I'm sure early sharing would lead to other kind of problems.I personally enjoyed, I had zero domain knowledge before beginning, a ""martian"" seeing people crash following a ball. This, I think, was a huge dissadvantage in this competition. But disciplined process led to some signal in the noise what was a big satisfaction. Also to experience this format was interesting for me.About the format, I think it probably achieves expected result for the organizers but it is much harder for kagglers  that take part on it;  ironically there's a high chance your hard worked kernel will get a fraction of the votes a quality kernel would get in a ""normal"" competition.

That¬¥s why I changed to Google Colab as operating system. I used Kaggle just for parallel data processing. I only used day 900+ for training.

Therefore, I think it is easier for our model to detect patterns in the data if the targets are within a range.Day-by-day:I chose a day-by-day model despite worse scores, because I was afraid of continuing a possible wrong trend with a recursive model.

So a strong and active LinkedIn presence would definitely help.If you do not have any professional experience (working at a company), it may make sense to contact recruiters or hiring managers at different companies and give them a sales pitch about why you want to work for them and what you can contribute, and try to get them to make you a role that may be unpaid just to get the experience - paid and unpaid internships were a big deal for college students that did not have a full degree yet when I was in college. Once you have a couple of years experience, it is a lot easier finding work.The internship/entry-level work in the data science career path is usually data analyst work, which mostly means data gathering and cleaning, not developing AI/ML models, because those roles are usually more senior, so showcasing some of that kind of data cleaning  and EDA work would be helpful.Also, try to get more commits on GitHub - a lot of recruiters look at that to see how active you are with projects.

2240,"In ggplot, the definition of the function follows the Layered Grammar of Graphics. You can see the definition of this grammar in the paper called ""A Layered Grammar of Graphics"" by Hadley Wickham. In addition, you can find more information about how to use R in the R for Data Science book.In a nutshell, data is a critical part of the plot, but the data is independent from other components (remember that we can build a plot using multiple datasets). Along with the data, we need to specify which variables are mapped to which aesthetics (that's what aes() do). An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot. Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points. You can display a point in different ways by changing the values of its aesthetic properties. Here is an example of what I have mentioned above:ggplot(data = mpg) +   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))Now let's say that I want to have all points with the same color. Instead of mapping the color with a aesthetic property of the dataset, I can define the colour outside the aesthetics:ggplot(data = mpg) +   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = ""blue"")Hope it helps!",Refashion this as a compelling sales pitch.,"Looking to craft compelling data visualizations with R and ggplot2?

You can see the definition of this grammar in the paper called ""A Layered Grammar of Graphics"" by Hadley Wickham. In addition, you can find more information about how to use R in the R for Data Science book.In a nutshell, data is a critical part of the plot, but the data is independent from other components (remember that we can build a plot using multiple datasets). Along with the data, we need to specify which variables are mapped to which aesthetics (that's what aes() do). An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot. Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points. You can display a point in different ways by changing the values of its aesthetic properties. Here is an example of what I have mentioned above:ggplot(data = mpg) +   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))Now let's say that I want to have all points with the same color. Instead of mapping the color with a aesthetic property of the dataset, I can define the colour outside the aesthetics:ggplot(data = mpg) +   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = ""blue"")Hope it helps!",Reinvent this as a whimsical fairy tale.,"In the whimsical world of ggplot, where data dances with aesthetics, there lived a function called ggplot.

2400,"In ggplot, the definition of the function follows the Layered Grammar of Graphics. You can see the definition of this grammar in the paper called ""A Layered Grammar of Graphics"" by Hadley Wickham. In addition, you can find more information about how to use R in the R for Data Science book.In a nutshell, data is a critical part of the plot, but the data is independent from other components (remember that we can build a plot using multiple datasets). Along with the data, we need to specify which variables are mapped to which aesthetics (that's what aes() do). An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot. Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points. You can display a point in different ways by changing the values of its aesthetic properties. Here is an example of what I have mentioned above:ggplot(data = mpg) +   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))Now let's say that I want to have all points with the same color. Instead of mapping the color with a aesthetic property of the dataset, I can define the colour outside the aesthetics:ggplot(data = mpg) +   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = ""blue"")Hope it helps!",Restyle this as a reality TV show plot.,"In the world of data visualization, ggplot reigns supreme.

2418,"This code ended up being my highest scoring submission, so I thought I'd do a quick write-up as to how it works.Like many of the other top submissions, it uses an ensemble of public agents, which includes the top 50 agents from rpscontest.com and some strong agents people posted on here, notably, I want to give credit to:memory patterns v7 by @yegorbiryukovgeometry bot by @superantmultiarmed bandit v32 by @ilialarI also add an evil twin agent for every one of those.The most important thing for this competition was probably how one selects actions from the ensemble. As for that, I have a few thoughts about what properties a good selection strategy should have:It should be fast at adapting to the opponentBecause the matches are so random, it should base its decision not only on a handful of observationsIt should be quite random so that it does not expose detectable patterns in the underlying agentsBased on those thoughts I came up with the strategy of first selecting a group of agents which performed well for some amount of time and then selecting a final agent out of this group based on its performance during the last few moves. Finally, the scores of the agents are not deterministic but drawn from a distribution, this way I introduce some randomness. I also tried out quite a few other more complicated strategies but this one seems to work best.Finally, I want to thank Kaggle for hosting this competition and everyone else for participating and having interesting discussions in the forum.import numpy as npfrom copy import deepcopyfrom kaggle_environments import agentfrom glob import globfrom functools import partial# path = '/kaggle_simulations/agent/'path = 'top/'def rps_agent(filename):    code = compile(open(filename).read(), filename, 'exec')    gg = {}    def run(observation, actual):        if observation.step &gt; 0:            inp = 'RPS'[observation.lastOpponentAction]            outp = 'RPS'[int(actual)]        else:            inp = ''            outp = ''        gg['input'] = inp        gg['output'] = outp        exec(code, gg)        return {'R': 0, 'P': 1, 'S': 2}[gg['output']]    return rundef kaggle_agent(filename): return agent.get_last_callable(agent.read_file(filename))def score(history, predictions):    actual = history[:, -1]    n = actual.shape[0]    p = lambda x: np.sum(predictions == (actual[:, np.newaxis] + x) % 3, axis=0) / n    p_win = p(1)    p_lose = p(-1)    return np.random.uniform(0, np.maximum(0, p_win - p_lose))def dirichlet(history, predictions):    actual = history[:, -1]    n, m = predictions.shape[:2]    n_outcome = np.array([        np.sum(predictions == (actual[:, np.newaxis] + i) % 3, axis=0)        for i in range(3)    ]).T    return np.array([np.random.dirichlet(n_outcome[i] + 1) for i in range(m)])[:, 1]def select_best(history, predictions, w, scoring_func, k):    w = min(history.shape[0], w)    q = scoring_func(history[-w:], predictions[-w:])    best = np.argpartition(q, -k)[-k:]    return bestdef reverse_agent(agent):    def f(observation, actual):        if observation.step &gt; 0: actual_actual = observation.lastOpponentAction        else: actual_actual = np.random.randint(0, 3)        observation = deepcopy(observation)        observation.lastOpponentAction = actual        return agent(observation, actual_actual)    return frps_agents = [    partial(rps_agent, filename) for filename in glob(path + 'rps/*.py')]kaggle_agents = [    partial(kaggle_agent, filename) for filename in glob(path + 'kaggle/*.py')]agents = rps_agents + kaggle_agentsinstances = [    *[agent() for agent in agents],    *[reverse_agent(agent()) for agent in agents],]N = 1000predictions = np.zeros(shape=(N, len(instances))).astype(np.int8)predictions[0] = np.random.randint(0, 3, size=len(instances))history = np.zeros(shape=(N, 2)).astype(np.int8)n = 0def run(observation, configuration):    global n    if n != 0:        history[n - 1, 1] = observation.lastOpponentAction    for i, agent in enumerate(instances):        predictions[n, i] = agent(observation, history[n - 1, 0])    if n &gt; 1:        candidates = np.hstack([(predictions[:n + 1] + i) % 3 for i in range(3)])        inner_circle = select_best(            history[:n],            candidates[:n],            150,            score,            7        )        candidates = candidates[:, inner_circle]        best = select_best(            history[:n],            candidates[:n],            np.random.randint(3, 7),            dirichlet,            1        )[0]        action = int(candidates[-1, best])    else:        action = np.random.randint(0, 3)    history[n, 0] = action    n += 1    return action",Dictate this as a royal decree.,"The code you provided is a well-written write-up of a high-scoring submission for a Kaggle competition.

Synthetic means that which is produced by synthesis, combining parts to form a whole; colloquially, a human-made version of that which has arisen naturally. A ""synthetic intelligence"" would therefore be or appear human-made, but not a simulation.The term was used by Haugeland in 1986 to describe artificial intelligence research up to that point, which he called ""good old fashioned artificial intelligence"" or ""GOFAI"". AI's first generation of researchers firmly believed their techniques would lead to real, human-like intelligence in machines. After the first AI winter, many AI researchers shifted their focus from artificial general intelligence to finding solutions for specific individual problems, such as machine learning, an approach to which some popular sources refer as ""weak AI"" or ""applied AI.""The term ""synthetic AI"" is now sometimes used by researchers in the field to separate their work (using subsymbolism, emergence, Psi-Theory, or other relatively new methods to define and create ""true"" intelligence) from previous attempts, particularly those of GOFAI or weak AI.Sources disagree about exactly what constitutes ""real"" intelligence as opposed to ""simulated"" intelligence and therefore whether there is a meaningful distinction between artificial intelligence and synthetic intelligence.(c) What Is AI? ‚Äì An introduction to artificial intelligence by John McCarthy‚Äîa co-founder of the field, and the person who coined the term.",Remodel this as a tech startup pitch.,"The field of synthetic intelligence (SI) offers a unique perspective on artificial intelligence (AI).

This tool features a simple, Pythonic interface and automatic encoding conversion to make it easy to work with website data. This library provides simple methods and Pythonic idioms for navigating, searching, and modifying a parse tree, and automatically converts incoming documents to Unicode and outgoing documents to UTF-8. Scrapy VS Beautiful SoupStructureScrapy is an open-source framework, whereas Beautiful Soup is a Python library designed for quick turnaround projects like screen-scraping. A framework inverts the control of the program and informs the developer what they need. Whereas in the case of a library, the developer calls the library where and when they need it.PerformanceDue to the built-in support for generating feed exports in multiple formats, as well as selecting and extracting data from various sources, the performance of Scrapy can be said to be faster than Beautiful Soup. Working with Beautiful Soup can speed up with the help of Multithreading process.ExtensibilityBeautiful Soup works best when working on smaller projects. On the other hand, Scrapy may be the better choice for larger projects with more complexities, as this framework can add custom functionalities and can develop pipelines with flexibility and speed.

2581,"TLDRWe used an approach similar to audio spectrogram classification using the EfficientNet-B0 model, with numerous augmentations and transformer models such as BERT and DeBERTa as helper models. The final solution consists of one EfficientNet-B0 with an input size of 160x80, trained on a single fold from 8 randomly split folds, as well as DeBERTa and BERT trained on the full dataset. A single fold model using EfficientNet has a CV score of 0.898 and a leaderboard score of ~0.8.We used only competition data.1. Data Preprocessing1.1 CNN PreprocessingWe extracted 18 lip points, 20 pose points (including arms, shoulders, eyebrows, and nose), and all hand points, resulting in a total of 80 points.During training, we applied various augmentations.We implemented standard normalization.Instead of dropping NaN values, we filled them with zeros after normalization.We interpolated the time axis to a size of 160 using 'nearest' interpolation: yy = F.interpolate(yy[None, None, :], size=self.new_size, mode='nearest').Finally, we obtained a tensor with dimensions 160x80x3, where 3 represents the (X, Y, Z) axes. 1.2 Transformer PreprocessingOnly 61 points were kept, including 40 lip points and 21 hand points. For left and right hand, the one with less NaN was kept. If right hand was kept, mirror it to left hand.Augmentations, normalization and NaN-filling were applied sequentially.Sequences longer than 96 were interpolated to 96. Sequences shorter than 96 were unchanged.Apart from raw positions, hand-crafted features were also used, including motion, distances, and cosine of angles.Motion features consist of future motion and history motion, which can be denoted as:$$  Motion_{future} = position_{t+1} - position_{t}$$$$  Motion_{history} = position_{t} - position_{t-1}$$Full 210 pairwise distances among 21 hand points were included. There are 5 vertices in a finger (e.g. thumb is [0,1,2,3,4]), and therefore, there are 3 angles: &lt;0,1,2&gt;, &lt;1,2,3&gt;, &lt;2,3,4&gt;. So 15 angles of 5 fingers were included.Randomly selected 190 pairwise distances and randomly selected 8 angles among 40 lip points were included.2. Augmentation2.1 Common Augmentations  These augmentations are used in both CNN training and transformer trainingRandom affine: Same as @hengck23 shared. In CNN, after global affine, shift-scale-rotate was also applied to each part separately (e.g. hand, lip, body-pose).Random interpolation: Slightly scale and shift the time dimension.Flip pose: Flip the x-coordinates of all points. In CNN, x_new = x_max - x_old. In transformer, x_new = 2 * frame[:,0,0] - x_old.Finger tree rotate: There are 4 root-children pairs in a finger with 5-vertices. E.g. in thumb ([0,1,2,3,4]), these 4 root-children pairs are: 0-[1,2,3,4],1-[2,3,4],2-[3,4],3-[4]. We randomly choose some of these pairs, and rotate the children points around root point with a small random angle.2.2 CNN Specific AugmentationsMixup: Implement basic mixup augmentation (only works with CNNs, not transformers).Replace augmentation: Replace some random parts from other samples of the same class.Time and frequence masking: This basic torchaudio augmentation works exceptionally well.freq_m = torchaudio.transforms.FrequencyMasking()  time_m = torchaudio.transforms.TimeMasking()       2.3 Augmented Sample ExampleBefore augmentation: After augmentation:  3. Training3.1 CNN TrainingTrain on one fold with a random split (8 folds in total) or the full dataset using the best parametersOnecycle scheduler with 0.1 warmup.Use weighted CrossEntropyLoss. Increase the weights for poorly predicted classes and classes with semantically similar pairs (such as kitty and cat)Implement a hypercolumn for EfficientNet with 5 blocks3.2 Transformer TrainingTrain on one fold with a random split (8 folds in total) or the full dataset using the best parametersRanger optimizer with 60% flat and 40% cosine annealing learning rate schedule.A 4-layer, 256 hidden-size, 512 intermediate-size transformer were trained.A 3-layer model was initialized with 4-layer model's first 3 layers. Knowledge distillation were used in 3-layer model training, in which the 4-layer model is the teacher.3.3 Hyperparameter TuningSince we trained only one fold and used smaller models, we decided to tune most parameters with Optuna. Here is the parameters list of CNN training (transformer training has a similar param-list):All augmentations probabilities (0.1 - 0.5+)Learning rate (2e-3 - 3e-3)Drop out (0.1 - 0.25)Num of epochs (170-185)Loss weights powers (0.75 - 2)Optimizer (Lookahead_RAdam, RAdam)Label smoothing (0.5 - 0.7)4. Submissions, Conversion and EnsembleWe rewrote all our models in Keras and transferred PyTorch weights to them, resulting in a speed boost of around 30%. For transformer model, pytorch-onnx-tf-tflite will generate too much useless tensor shape operations, a fully rewriting can reduce these manually. For CNN model, we rewrote DepthwiseConv2D with a hard-coded way, whose speed is 200%~300% of its original version of tflite DepthwiseConv2D.After that, we aggregated all these models in the tf.Module class. Converting directly from Keras resulted in lower speed (don't know why).We calculated ensemble weights for models trained on fold 0 using the local fold 0 score and applied these weights to the full dataset models.EfficientNet-B0 achieved a leaderboard score of approximately 0.8, and transformers improved the score to 0.81. The final ensemble included:Efficientnet-B0, fold 0BERT, full data trainDeBERTa, full data trainInterestingly, a key feature was using the ensemble without softmax, which consistently provided a boost of around 0.01.5. PS. Need BETTER TFlite DepthwiseConv2DDepthwise convolution models performed very well for these tasks, outperforming other CNN and ViT models (rexnet_100 was also good).We spent a lot of time dealing with the conversion of DepthwiseConv2D operation. Here are some strange results:Given a input image with 82x42x32 (HWC), there are two ways to do a 3x3 depthwise convolution in Keras. One is Conv2D(32, 3, groups = 32), the other is DepthwiseConv2D(3). However, after converting these two to tflite, the running time of the Conv2D is 5.05ms, and the running time of DepthwiseConv2D is 3.70ms. More strangely, a full convolution Conv2D(32, 3, groups = 1) with FLOPs = HWC^2 only takes 2.09ms, even faster than previous two with FLOPs = HWC.Then we rewrote the depthwise-conv like this:     ():        out = x[:,:self.H_out:self.strides,:self.W_out:self.strides] * self.weight[,]         i  (self.kernel_size):             j  (self.kernel_size):                 i ==   j == :                                    out += x[:,i:self.H_out + i:self.strides,j:self.W_out + j:self.strides] * self.weight[i,j]         self.bias   :            out = out + self.bias         outThe running time of this is 1.24 ms.In summary, our version (1.24ms) &gt; full Conv2D with larger FLOPs (2.09ms) &gt; DepthwiseConv2D (3.70ms) &gt; Conv2D(C, groups = C) (5.05ms).However, our version introduced too much nodes in tflite graph, which is not stable in running time. If the tensorflow team has a better implementation of DepthwiseConv2D, we can even ensemble two CNN models, which is expected to reach 0.82 LB.By the way, EfficientNet with ONNX was ~5 times faster than TFLite.Big thanks to my teammates @artemtprv and @carnozhao and congrats with new tiers, Master and GrandMaster!github code",Respin this as a breathtaking revelation.,"The text you provided is a detailed description of a solution for a competition.

2820,"Scrapy:Scrapy is an open-source and collaborative framework for extracting the data you need from websites in a fast and simple manner. This tool can be used for extracting data using APIs. It can also be used as a general-purpose web crawler. Thus, Scrapy is an application framework, which can be used for writing web spiders that crawl websites and extract data from them.The framework provides a built-in mechanism for extracting data ‚Äì known as selectors ‚Äì and can be used for data mining, automated testing, etc. Scrapy is supported under Python 3.5+ under CPython and PyPy starting with PyPy 5.9.BeautifulSoup:Beautiful Soup is one of the most popular Python libraries which helps in parsing HTML or XML documents into a tree structure to find and extract data. This tool features a simple, Pythonic interface and automatic encoding conversion to make it easy to work with website data. This library provides simple methods and Pythonic idioms for navigating, searching, and modifying a parse tree, and automatically converts incoming documents to Unicode and outgoing documents to UTF-8. Scrapy VS Beautiful SoupStructureScrapy is an open-source framework, whereas Beautiful Soup is a Python library designed for quick turnaround projects like screen-scraping. A framework inverts the control of the program and informs the developer what they need. Whereas in the case of a library, the developer calls the library where and when they need it.PerformanceDue to the built-in support for generating feed exports in multiple formats, as well as selecting and extracting data from various sources, the performance of Scrapy can be said to be faster than Beautiful Soup. Working with Beautiful Soup can speed up with the help of Multithreading process.ExtensibilityBeautiful Soup works best when working on smaller projects. On the other hand, Scrapy may be the better choice for larger projects with more complexities, as this framework can add custom functionalities and can develop pipelines with flexibility and speed.  Beginner-FriendlyFor a beginner who is trying hands-on web scraping for the first time, Beautiful Soup is the best choice to start with. Scrapy can be used for scraping, but it is comparatively more complex than the former. CommunityThe developer‚Äôs community of Scrapy is stronger and vast compared to that of Beautiful Soup. Also, developers can use Beautiful Soup for parsing HTML responses in Scrapy callbacks by feeding the response‚Äôs body into a BeautifulSoup object and extracting whatever data they need from it.link: https://analyticsindiamag.com/scrapy-vs-beautiful-soup-a-comparison-of-web-crawling-tools/If you like this Topic and you find it useful UPVOTE",Recontextualize this as a mind-bending revelation.,"Scrapy and Beautiful Soup are two popular Python tools for extracting data from websites.

I would partition a AI project in follow phases:A. ==== Training:1). any training has input data for input features, and output true data for output features2). When a training is done, we calculate the difference between ""true output"" with ""calculated output"" to get accuracy .B. ==== Validating:1). Validating is a part of training if people split all data into two, or k-fold groups: training data and validating data.2). K-fold type model will automatically split data and adjust model based upon ""training"" of training and validating of training in one run.3). The ""Predict"" used by Python seems like the ""calculated"" output of validating which is still belong to training phase. Python using ""Predict"" is quite misleading since to common sense the ""Predict"" is equal to Forecasting for out-of-sample data.C. ==== Testing(Forecasting, or custom accept testing)In this phase, customer will use his data(out-of-samples) to  fit the model and to see if the statistics of output features are meet his requirements.

3128,"Hi @imadali595,Awesome work on this notebook.I have a few suggestions for things you could add to make it even better:Check your ROC curves:Beside the metrics you check, I would suggest plotting the ROC curve because it is a useful tool for better understanding your model performance under different thresholds. You can use this: from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, plot_roc_curveUse cross-validation:While splitting your data into train and test sets is an important step in the machine learning pipeline, it is not enough to ensure that your model generalizes well to unseen data. I suggest using cross-validation to evaluate your model's performance. You can use cross_val_score from sklearn.model_selection to calculate the average accuracy of your model across multiple folds. This way, you can be more confident that your model is not overfitting to the training set and is generalizing well to new data.Nonlinear Models:It might be worth trying out some non-linear models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) as they may be able to achieve better results by capturing complex and deeper relationships in the data. Most models today have the same interface to it is easy to try out different models.Consider using KDE instead of histograms:While your histogram plot is informative, it can be improved by using a kernel density estimate (KDE) plot instead of a histogram. KDE is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. It is smoother than a histogram and provides a better estimate of the underlying distribution. You can use seaborn package to create a KDE plot.  seaborn  snsfigure = plt.figure(figsize=(, ))sns.kdeplot(train[train[] == ][], shade=, label=)sns.kdeplot(train[train[] == ][], shade=, label=)Normalize The Data:I suggest normalizing the data before fitting the model. While some models will not benfit from this, others will (and it is also easy to check and see..). It can be essential to normalize / scale (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler) for equally representing all features.Optimize Hyperparameters:You can easily improve your model by tuning the hyperparameters. One approach is to use validation and simply try different values and combinations. (Grid search: GridSearchCV example)Have a great day!

In the first week of the contest, I gave Kaggle the details about the leakage I found. &nbsp;Cornell / Marineexplore then promptly revised the dataset, and then the competition was restarted. &nbsp;The revision fixed most of the issue, and the algorithm that got 0.9973 on the original dataset (using only leakage) could only achieve a 0.59 AUC on the revised dataset.The leakage came from three sources:The distribution of file lengths (in bytes) The &nbsp;timestamp embedded in the audio clip filename (focusing mostly on the millisecond field)The chronological order of the clips (ordered using the full timestamp) &nbsp;File SizesAfter downloading the data and typing a simple ‚Äúls -lS‚Äù, I noticed that a large number of &nbsp;audio clip files had both the same size and the same label (i.e. whale vs no-whale). &nbsp;Interestingly, fIles with the same size were not duplicates (their md5sums differed). &nbsp;This seemed fishy.To &nbsp;investigate further, I made histograms of the file sizes, broken down by label. &nbsp;Audio files with whale upcalls turned out to have a very specific set of file sizes (see this ‚Äúcomb-like‚Äùhistogram&nbsp;&nbsp;where some files are multiples of 148 bytes plus a constant). &nbsp;In contrast, files without whale upcalls had sizes that looked &nbsp;much more evenly distributed (see this&nbsp;histogram).&nbsp;Thus, certain file sizes provided a strong indication that a clip had a whale upcall in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;Also, files with whale upcalls were larger, on average. &nbsp;Millisecond timestampsAnother anomaly was related to the timestamps embedded in the filenames. &nbsp;If a whale upcall was not in a file, the millisecond field in the timestamp was almost always a multiple of 10 ms &nbsp;(seethis).&nbsp;However, if a whale upcall was in a file, the millisecond field seemed evenly distributed in time - i.e. multiples of 1 ms (seethis). &nbsp;Thus, a zero in the last digit of the millisecond field was strongly predictive; using a simple test for zero as a binary feature yielded a 0.945 AUC by itself.Next, additional histograms of the millisecond timestamps showed that the audio clips without whale upcalls were more likely to start in the first half of a given second &nbsp;(seethis).&nbsp;Clips with whale upcalls were more evenly distributed across time (seethis).Putting these observations together, it seems like the audio clips with upcalls were processed in a different way than those without upcalls. &nbsp;As a competitor, though, &nbsp;it‚Äôs impossible to tell what the true root causes of these differences were, or if they could be useful.Clip orderin the first Whale Detection challenge, the (chronological) ordering of the clips contained information. The same was true in this contest. &nbsp;A moving average of clip labels in the training set showed a familiar pattern: minutes or hours of high whale-call activity, followed by equally lengthy lulls &nbsp;(see this). &nbsp;A moving average could be used to capture some of this serial correlation in the leaked test clip labels, providing a ‚Äútemporally local‚Äù probability of a whale upcall.FeaturesTo take advantage of all these observations, &nbsp;I created the following features:File size in bytes (as an integer) File size in bytes (as a categorical variable). Timestamp_milliseconds (as an integer) 0 if timestamp_milliseconds was a multiple of 10, 1 otherwise 0 if timestamp_milliseconds was a multiple of 10, moving average of the above 0/1 feature otherwiseA logistic regression using these simple features yielded 0.9973 AUC on the leaderboard. &nbsp;I used the ‚Äòglmnet‚Äô package in R for logistic regression, and python to create the features.FixesCornell corrected these anomalies by:Capping the file size so that most files were exactly 2 seconds long (8088 bytes).Reducing the millisecond field in the filename timestamp from 3 digits down to 1 (though what that 1 digit represents is unclear).I think it‚Äôs easy to see how these slight anomalies could go unnoticed, though some turned out to be unexpectedly effective predictors. Even if competitors didn‚Äôt notice these these anomalies, it‚Äôs possible that some algorithms might have silently picked up on them if they weren‚Äôt corrected.Like software bugs, leakage seems hard to avoid entirely. I applaud Kaggle &amp; Cornell for swiftly fixing these issues once they were found.",Reinvent this as a heart-stopping revelation.,"The data leakage found in the first release of the dataset was substantial and had the potential to undermine the credibility of the leaderboard scores. I found that it was possible to achieve an impressive 0.9973 AUC using only leakage, without reading the audio files.

3332,"This code ended up being my highest scoring submission, so I thought I'd do a quick write-up as to how it works.Like many of the other top submissions, it uses an ensemble of public agents, which includes the top 50 agents from rpscontest.com and some strong agents people posted on here, notably, I want to give credit to:memory patterns v7 by @yegorbiryukovgeometry bot by @superantmultiarmed bandit v32 by @ilialarI also add an evil twin agent for every one of those.The most important thing for this competition was probably how one selects actions from the ensemble. As for that, I have a few thoughts about what properties a good selection strategy should have:It should be fast at adapting to the opponentBecause the matches are so random, it should base its decision not only on a handful of observationsIt should be quite random so that it does not expose detectable patterns in the underlying agentsBased on those thoughts I came up with the strategy of first selecting a group of agents which performed well for some amount of time and then selecting a final agent out of this group based on its performance during the last few moves. Finally, the scores of the agents are not deterministic but drawn from a distribution, this way I introduce some randomness. I also tried out quite a few other more complicated strategies but this one seems to work best.Finally, I want to thank Kaggle for hosting this competition and everyone else for participating and having interesting discussions in the forum.import numpy as npfrom copy import deepcopyfrom kaggle_environments import agentfrom glob import globfrom functools import partial# path = '/kaggle_simulations/agent/'path = 'top/'def rps_agent(filename):    code = compile(open(filename).read(), filename, 'exec')    gg = {}    def run(observation, actual):        if observation.step &gt; 0:            inp = 'RPS'[observation.lastOpponentAction]            outp = 'RPS'[int(actual)]        else:            inp = ''            outp = ''        gg['input'] = inp        gg['output'] = outp        exec(code, gg)        return {'R': 0, 'P': 1, 'S': 2}[gg['output']]    return rundef kaggle_agent(filename): return agent.get_last_callable(agent.read_file(filename))def score(history, predictions):    actual = history[:, -1]    n = actual.shape[0]    p = lambda x: np.sum(predictions == (actual[:, np.newaxis] + x) % 3, axis=0) / n    p_win = p(1)    p_lose = p(-1)    return np.random.uniform(0, np.maximum(0, p_win - p_lose))def dirichlet(history, predictions):    actual = history[:, -1]    n, m = predictions.shape[:2]    n_outcome = np.array([        np.sum(predictions == (actual[:, np.newaxis] + i) % 3, axis=0)        for i in range(3)    ]).T    return np.array([np.random.dirichlet(n_outcome[i] + 1) for i in range(m)])[:, 1]def select_best(history, predictions, w, scoring_func, k):    w = min(history.shape[0], w)    q = scoring_func(history[-w:], predictions[-w:])    best = np.argpartition(q, -k)[-k:]    return bestdef reverse_agent(agent):    def f(observation, actual):        if observation.step &gt; 0: actual_actual = observation.lastOpponentAction        else: actual_actual = np.random.randint(0, 3)        observation = deepcopy(observation)        observation.lastOpponentAction = actual        return agent(observation, actual_actual)    return frps_agents = [    partial(rps_agent, filename) for filename in glob(path + 'rps/*.py')]kaggle_agents = [    partial(kaggle_agent, filename) for filename in glob(path + 'kaggle/*.py')]agents = rps_agents + kaggle_agentsinstances = [    *[agent() for agent in agents],    *[reverse_agent(agent()) for agent in agents],]N = 1000predictions = np.zeros(shape=(N, len(instances))).astype(np.int8)predictions[0] = np.random.randint(0, 3, size=len(instances))history = np.zeros(shape=(N, 2)).astype(np.int8)n = 0def run(observation, configuration):    global n    if n != 0:        history[n - 1, 1] = observation.lastOpponentAction    for i, agent in enumerate(instances):        predictions[n, i] = agent(observation, history[n - 1, 0])    if n &gt; 1:        candidates = np.hstack([(predictions[:n + 1] + i) % 3 for i in range(3)])        inner_circle = select_best(            history[:n],            candidates[:n],            150,            score,            7        )        candidates = candidates[:, inner_circle]        best = select_best(            history[:n],            candidates[:n],            np.random.randint(3, 7),            dirichlet,            1        )[0]        action = int(candidates[-1, best])    else:        action = np.random.randint(0, 3)    history[n, 0] = action    n += 1    return action",Set this as a scene in a dystopian novel.,"The code you provided is a well-written and detailed write-up of a high-scoring submission for a Kaggle competition.

Synthetic means that which is produced by synthesis, combining parts to form a whole; colloquially, a human-made version of that which has arisen naturally.

This is a quick and easy option, but it may not always produce the best results.Use a separate category for missing values: This involves creating a new category specifically for missing values. This can be useful if the missing values have some meaningful interpretation.Use multiple imputations: This involves using advanced techniques to impute the missing values in a way that takes into account the uncertainty associated with the imputation.

Please check this out and upvote.introductionWe publish our solution.Since it is English generated by google translate, I think that there are some unnatural parts, but please forgive me as I will correct it as much as possible later.overviewWe preprocessed ""name"" and ""address"", according to each language, and converted them to embedding.We generated candidates from distance, name similarity, word and character precision, and recall based on multiple regression.Prediction was made by LightGBM binary classificationIn the post-processing, the edge whose predicted value exceeds the threshold is divided into subgraphs by Union Find Tree (Disjoint Set), and then the one whose shortest distance is within 2 is selected.The jump to 0.933-&gt; 0.951 that everyone cares about happened when I replaced one of the 5-folds from one that was early stopping at 500 iterations to one that was trained at 2000 iterations with all the data.PreprocessingNatural language preprocessingSince the name and address were multilingual, I prepared three separate processes.Almost raw textText for each language with lowercase letters, removal of symbols, and digitization of numeralsAbout 2. Text converted to [0-9a-z &amp;] with unidecodeAlso, since there were many nans for the address, we complemented by connecting three neighborhoods of the distance.Processing for each languageBasically, all languages ‚Äã‚Äãhave uniform removal of symbols-&gt; lowercase letters / digitization of numbers-&gt; alphabetization.Since Japanese, Chinese, and Thai are languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat require word-separation, they are processed individually.For Japanese, use the tokenizer Sudachi to get the word-separation and reading, and then use Pykakasi to convert it to romaji. did.Chinese was divided by zh_segmehntation and converted to romaji by unidecode.Thai is divided and romanized using PyThaiNLP.city, state pre-processingFor city and state, we took out about 2000 in order of the number of appearances and put them in the category of fitting to any of 2000 in the vicinity of the distance.We also converted it to the top 2000 place names using the cities1000 dataset and made it into a category. (Hereafter referred to as geo_name)Creating an embeddingFor the text of 3 in the previous section, the name and address were divided into 32000 subwords using different sentence pieces.On top of this, we learned embedding by the following three unsupervised pre-learning based on word2vec.About name Skip-gram taskTask to predict categories from name, address, city, state, geo_nameA contrasting learning task that mixes name, address, city, state, geo_name, categories and guesses itself by SimCSEWhen doing these learnings, the method of obtaining negative samples was very important.We were able to perform high-quality learning by generating a negative sample with a random walk for each sample, using the probability based on the negative logarithm of the hadsine distance as the edge for the vicinity of 128 of each sample.Fill in missing values ‚Äã‚Äãin a categoryNow that we have a good model for category prediction, we filled in the missing values ‚Äã‚Äãby making predictions for those with blank categories.Clustering / one-dimensionalEach embedding was divided into about 2000 clusters by spherical kmmeans ++.We also implemented kmeans ++ based on the hadsine distance and divided it into about 2000 clusters as well.After splitting the cluster, we embedded the information in one dimension by solving the traveling salesman problem for the distance between each vertex.This is a technique called Word Tour, which allows you to transform embedding into a form that GBDT can easily interpret in just one dimension.Each category was sorted by TSP based on the similarity of each kmeans, the similarity of names and addresses with the number of occurrences top2000, and the haversine distances of city, state, and geoname, and used as continuous values.Feature generationhaversine distanceThe logarithm of the distance between two points was taken and used as a feature. The conversion to logarithm will be useful in later candidate generation.name, addressWe have created various comparative features for both.Obtained from a public notebookGestalt Pattern Matching (SequenceMatcher), levenshtein, jaro_winkler (I will omit it because it was introduced in various kernels)Bag of Words, Bag of CharFor the word that was divided and normalized, TfIdfVectorizer was set to binary = True, use_idf = False, and 1-gram and 2-gram sparse vectors were created and the similarity was compared.Also, considering the case where characters have meaning like Japanese and Chinese, we created sparse vectors for each character and compared the similarity.ROUGE-N, ROUGE-LROUGE is an index often used to evaluate sentence summarization tasks. Measure the degree of agreement between sentences and give precision, recall, f1 value.ROUGE-N was compared using N-GRAM, ROUGE-L was compared using LCS, the former was implemented using tensorflow's Ragged Tensor, and the latter was implemented using tensorflow-text's rouge_l function.Cosine similarity, one-dimensional distanceFor each embedding, the cosine similarity and the distance after dropping to one dimension are added as features.city / stateSimilar to embedding, the top 2000 cities and states are listed as features in the order of Count Encoding and traveling salesman problem.categoriesI also got the category embedding by doing metric learning about the category prediction task during pre-learning.Like the other features, the category embedding is based on the count encoding as the features arranged in the traveling salesman problem.phone / urlOnly whether or not they match after normalization was added as a feature quantity.Candidate generationCandidate generation for learning and prediction combines multiple logics.haversine 4 nearest neighbors of distanceHaversine 12 multiple regressions of distance logarithm and embedding cosine similarity such as name, address, categories, etc.About name Similarity by rouge-1 in word unit, precision, recall Total 4About name A total of 8 similarities, precision, and recall by rouge-2 in character unitsTop 4 cosine similarity of namepredictI used LightGBM. 2000 iterations training was performed on all data without early stopping, and GPU prediction was performed by Forest Inference at the time of prediction.The hyperparameters are as follows, and max_bin has been increased only for some categories.max_bin_by_feature = []for col in feature_cols:    if (col.endswith (""kmeans_labels"") or col.endswith (""pos_tsp_index"")) and col.startswith (""query""):        print (col)        max_bin_by_feature.append (255 * 4)    elif (col.endswith (""kmeans_labels"") or col.endswith (""pos_tsp_index"")) and col.startswith (""candidate""):        print (col)        max_bin_by_feature.append (255 * 2)    elif col.endswith (""_category_frequent_min_tsp"") or col.endswith (""_category_frequent_max_tsp""):        print (col)        max_bin_by_feature.append (255 * 2)    else: else:        max_bin_by_feature.append (255)lgb_params = {    ""objective"": ""binary"",    ""metric"": ""auc"",    ""boosting"":'gbdt',    ""max_depth"": -1, -1,    ""num_leaves"": 2 ** 12 --1,    ""learning_rate"": 0.1,    ""bagging_freq"": 1,    ""is_unbalance"": True,    ""max_bin_by_feature"": max_bin_by_feature,     ""bin_construct_sample_cnt"": 200000,    ""lambda_l1"": 1.,    ""lambda_l2"": 1.,    ""bagging_fraction"": 0.9,    ""feature_fraction"": 0.6,    ""seed"": 0}Post-processingThe graph was constructed for each group by UnionFind after removing some edges based on the mediation centrality of the graph, with the predicted values ‚Äã‚Äãof the pair being above a certain level.For each group, the shortest distance to all pairs of unweighted graphs was calculated, and the predicted value was within 256 vertices within 2 distances from each vertex.",Make this rhyme.,"The text is well-written and easy to understand, but it could be improved.

That¬¥s why I changed to Google Colab as operating system. I used Kaggle just for parallel data processing. I only used day 900+ for training.

I have saved a separate training dataset for each day to reduce the amount of data.Features:Features - Lags:- Rolling Lags (7, 14 - I just realized that i forgot to add the other rolling lags as 28 and 180 etc. in my final model.. )- Lags (1-7)Features - Prices:- Price Max, Min, Std, Mean- New Item (Yes/No - I created 20 categories and labeled the last two as Yes)- Time since release- Difference of each price to the mean price- Price normalization- Unique prices for each item- Max, Min, Std, Mean saisonal prices (for each year)- Difference of each price to the saisonal mean price- Rolling price last 15 days- Difference to this averageFeatures - Calendar:- Day, week and month of the year- Day of the week- Week of the month- Month of the year- End of the week yes/no- Start/end of the month yes/no- Start/end of the quarter yes/no- Start/end of the year yes/no- Lags to the events (Many people shop the day before ;) )Mean Encoding:- Id cat, Id dept, Id item mean encoding- Id cat, Id dept, Id item std encodingLoss/objective:- Standard RMSE and tweedie since I didn¬¥t get anything else working well for meThings which didn¬¥t work for me:- Target transformation: dividing each sales for each item by the mean value of the item- Target transformation: using revenue as target and revenue as lags and dividing it afterwards by the sell price- Target transformation: Normalization of each target by item id- Target transformation: Using the mean of the last month as multiplier for the other salesI have invested so much time in the target transformation to make the time series stationary. I wanted to test with the deltas (t - t-1), but unfortunately I didn't have any more time, because I joined very late (https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy/discussion/155950).I just wanted to say thank you @kyakovlev for the very valuable input over the whole competition period.

This seems like it would cause arbitrary issues with capturing the full call or song sequences. What is the reasoning for not doing analysis on the spectrogram of the full audio clip?I have at least one guess for why we need to chop into chunks:      Images may be different sizes due to differing lengths or the patterns will get distorted if we try to make all the images the same size.

3832,"There are several ways to handle missing values of categorical variables. Here are a few options:Ignore the rows with missing values: This is only a viable option if the number of rows with missing values is small compared to the total number of rows.Impute the missing values: This involves replacing the missing values with some other value, such as the mode (most frequent value) of the variable. This is a quick and easy option, but it may not always produce the best results.Use a separate category for missing values: This involves creating a new category specifically for missing values. This can be useful if the missing values have some meaningful interpretation.Use multiple imputations: This involves using advanced techniques to impute the missing values in a way that takes into account the uncertainty associated with the imputation. Multiple imputations can produce more accurate results than simple imputation, but it is also more complex and time-consuming.Which option you choose will depend on the nature of your data and the goals of your analysis.",Weave this into a fable about the importance of cooperation and understanding in a universe filled with diversity.,"In a vast cosmic expanse teeming with celestial wonders, there lived a diverse group of celestial beings.

Please check this out and upvote.introductionWe publish our solution.Since it is English generated by google translate, I think that there are some unnatural parts, but please forgive me as I will correct it as much as possible later.overviewWe preprocessed ""name"" and ""address"", according to each language, and converted them to embedding.We generated candidates from distance, name similarity, word and character precision, and recall based on multiple regression.Prediction was made by LightGBM binary classificationIn the post-processing, the edge whose predicted value exceeds the threshold is divided into subgraphs by Union Find Tree (Disjoint Set), and then the one whose shortest distance is within 2 is selected.The jump to 0.933-&gt; 0.951 that everyone cares about happened when I replaced one of the 5-folds from one that was early stopping at 500 iterations to one that was trained at 2000 iterations with all the data.PreprocessingNatural language preprocessingSince the name and address were multilingual, I prepared three separate processes.Almost raw textText for each language with lowercase letters, removal of symbols, and digitization of numeralsAbout 2. Text converted to [0-9a-z &amp;] with unidecodeAlso, since there were many nans for the address, we complemented by connecting three neighborhoods of the distance.Processing for each languageBasically, all languages ‚Äã‚Äãhave uniform removal of symbols-&gt; lowercase letters / digitization of numbers-&gt; alphabetization.Since Japanese, Chinese, and Thai are languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat require word-separation, they are processed individually.For Japanese, use the tokenizer Sudachi to get the word-separation and reading, and then use Pykakasi to convert it to romaji. did.Chinese was divided by zh_segmehntation and converted to romaji by unidecode.Thai is divided and romanized using PyThaiNLP.city, state pre-processingFor city and state, we took out about 2000 in order of the number of appearances and put them in the category of fitting to any of 2000 in the vicinity of the distance.We also converted it to the top 2000 place names using the cities1000 dataset and made it into a category. (Hereafter referred to as geo_name)Creating an embeddingFor the text of 3 in the previous section, the name and address were divided into 32000 subwords using different sentence pieces.On top of this, we learned embedding by the following three unsupervised pre-learning based on word2vec.About name Skip-gram taskTask to predict categories from name, address, city, state, geo_nameA contrasting learning task that mixes name, address, city, state, geo_name, categories and guesses itself by SimCSEWhen doing these learnings, the method of obtaining negative samples was very important.We were able to perform high-quality learning by generating a negative sample with a random walk for each sample, using the probability based on the negative logarithm of the hadsine distance as the edge for the vicinity of 128 of each sample.Fill in missing values ‚Äã‚Äãin a categoryNow that we have a good model for category prediction, we filled in the missing values ‚Äã‚Äãby making predictions for those with blank categories.Clustering / one-dimensionalEach embedding was divided into about 2000 clusters by spherical kmmeans ++.We also implemented kmeans ++ based on the hadsine distance and divided it into about 2000 clusters as well.After splitting the cluster, we embedded the information in one dimension by solving the traveling salesman problem for the distance between each vertex.This is a technique called Word Tour, which allows you to transform embedding into a form that GBDT can easily interpret in just one dimension.Each category was sorted by TSP based on the similarity of each kmeans, the similarity of names and addresses with the number of occurrences top2000, and the haversine distances of city, state, and geoname, and used as continuous values.Feature generationhaversine distanceThe logarithm of the distance between two points was taken and used as a feature. The conversion to logarithm will be useful in later candidate generation.name, addressWe have created various comparative features for both.Obtained from a public notebookGestalt Pattern Matching (SequenceMatcher), levenshtein, jaro_winkler (I will omit it because it was introduced in various kernels)Bag of Words, Bag of CharFor the word that was divided and normalized, TfIdfVectorizer was set to binary = True, use_idf = False, and 1-gram and 2-gram sparse vectors were created and the similarity was compared.Also, considering the case where characters have meaning like Japanese and Chinese, we created sparse vectors for each character and compared the similarity.ROUGE-N, ROUGE-LROUGE is an index often used to evaluate sentence summarization tasks. Measure the degree of agreement between sentences and give precision, recall, f1 value.ROUGE-N was compared using N-GRAM, ROUGE-L was compared using LCS, the former was implemented using tensorflow's Ragged Tensor, and the latter was implemented using tensorflow-text's rouge_l function.Cosine similarity, one-dimensional distanceFor each embedding, the cosine similarity and the distance after dropping to one dimension are added as features.city / stateSimilar to embedding, the top 2000 cities and states are listed as features in the order of Count Encoding and traveling salesman problem.categoriesI also got the category embedding by doing metric learning about the category prediction task during pre-learning.Like the other features, the category embedding is based on the count encoding as the features arranged in the traveling salesman problem.phone / urlOnly whether or not they match after normalization was added as a feature quantity.Candidate generationCandidate generation for learning and prediction combines multiple logics.haversine 4 nearest neighbors of distanceHaversine 12 multiple regressions of distance logarithm and embedding cosine similarity such as name, address, categories, etc.About name Similarity by rouge-1 in word unit, precision, recall Total 4About name A total of 8 similarities, precision, and recall by rouge-2 in character unitsTop 4 cosine similarity of namepredictI used LightGBM. 2000 iterations training was performed on all data without early stopping, and GPU prediction was performed by Forest Inference at the time of prediction.The hyperparameters are as follows, and max_bin has been increased only for some categories.max_bin_by_feature = []for col in feature_cols:    if (col.endswith (""kmeans_labels"") or col.endswith (""pos_tsp_index"")) and col.startswith (""query""):        print (col)        max_bin_by_feature.append (255 * 4)    elif (col.endswith (""kmeans_labels"") or col.endswith (""pos_tsp_index"")) and col.startswith (""candidate""):        print (col)        max_bin_by_feature.append (255 * 2)    elif col.endswith (""_category_frequent_min_tsp"") or col.endswith (""_category_frequent_max_tsp""):        print (col)        max_bin_by_feature.append (255 * 2)    else: else:        max_bin_by_feature.append (255)lgb_params = {    ""objective"": ""binary"",    ""metric"": ""auc"",    ""boosting"":'gbdt',    ""max_depth"": -1, -1,    ""num_leaves"": 2 ** 12 --1,    ""learning_rate"": 0.1,    ""bagging_freq"": 1,    ""is_unbalance"": True,    ""max_bin_by_feature"": max_bin_by_feature,     ""bin_construct_sample_cnt"": 200000,    ""lambda_l1"": 1.,    ""lambda_l2"": 1.,    ""bagging_fraction"": 0.9,    ""feature_fraction"": 0.6,    ""seed"": 0}Post-processingThe graph was constructed for each group by UnionFind after removing some edges based on the mediation centrality of the graph, with the predicted values ‚Äã‚Äãof the pair being above a certain level.For each group, the shortest distance to all pairs of unweighted graphs was calculated, and the predicted value was within 256 vertices within 2 distances from each vertex.",Morph this into a space opera.,"The text has been rewritten to make it more concise and clear.

4151,"TLDRWe used an approach similar to audio spectrogram classification using the EfficientNet-B0 model, with numerous augmentations and transformer models such as BERT and DeBERTa as helper models. The final solution consists of one EfficientNet-B0 with an input size of 160x80, trained on a single fold from 8 randomly split folds, as well as DeBERTa and BERT trained on the full dataset. A single fold model using EfficientNet has a CV score of 0.898 and a leaderboard score of ~0.8.We used only competition data.1. Data Preprocessing1.1 CNN PreprocessingWe extracted 18 lip points, 20 pose points (including arms, shoulders, eyebrows, and nose), and all hand points, resulting in a total of 80 points.During training, we applied various augmentations.We implemented standard normalization.Instead of dropping NaN values, we filled them with zeros after normalization.We interpolated the time axis to a size of 160 using 'nearest' interpolation: yy = F.interpolate(yy[None, None, :], size=self.new_size, mode='nearest').Finally, we obtained a tensor with dimensions 160x80x3, where 3 represents the (X, Y, Z) axes. 1.2 Transformer PreprocessingOnly 61 points were kept, including 40 lip points and 21 hand points. For left and right hand, the one with less NaN was kept. If right hand was kept, mirror it to left hand.Augmentations, normalization and NaN-filling were applied sequentially.Sequences longer than 96 were interpolated to 96. Sequences shorter than 96 were unchanged.Apart from raw positions, hand-crafted features were also used, including motion, distances, and cosine of angles.Motion features consist of future motion and history motion, which can be denoted as:$$  Motion_{future} = position_{t+1} - position_{t}$$$$  Motion_{history} = position_{t} - position_{t-1}$$Full 210 pairwise distances among 21 hand points were included. There are 5 vertices in a finger (e.g. thumb is [0,1,2,3,4]), and therefore, there are 3 angles: &lt;0,1,2&gt;, &lt;1,2,3&gt;, &lt;2,3,4&gt;. So 15 angles of 5 fingers were included.Randomly selected 190 pairwise distances and randomly selected 8 angles among 40 lip points were included.2. Augmentation2.1 Common Augmentations  These augmentations are used in both CNN training and transformer trainingRandom affine: Same as @hengck23 shared. In CNN, after global affine, shift-scale-rotate was also applied to each part separately (e.g. hand, lip, body-pose).Random interpolation: Slightly scale and shift the time dimension.Flip pose: Flip the x-coordinates of all points. In CNN, x_new = x_max - x_old. In transformer, x_new = 2 * frame[:,0,0] - x_old.Finger tree rotate: There are 4 root-children pairs in a finger with 5-vertices. E.g. in thumb ([0,1,2,3,4]), these 4 root-children pairs are: 0-[1,2,3,4],1-[2,3,4],2-[3,4],3-[4]. We randomly choose some of these pairs, and rotate the children points around root point with a small random angle.2.2 CNN Specific AugmentationsMixup: Implement basic mixup augmentation (only works with CNNs, not transformers).Replace augmentation: Replace some random parts from other samples of the same class.Time and frequence masking: This basic torchaudio augmentation works exceptionally well.freq_m = torchaudio.transforms.FrequencyMasking()  time_m = torchaudio.transforms.TimeMasking()       2.3 Augmented Sample ExampleBefore augmentation: After augmentation:  3. Training3.1 CNN TrainingTrain on one fold with a random split (8 folds in total) or the full dataset using the best parametersOnecycle scheduler with 0.1 warmup.Use weighted CrossEntropyLoss. Increase the weights for poorly predicted classes and classes with semantically similar pairs (such as kitty and cat)Implement a hypercolumn for EfficientNet with 5 blocks3.2 Transformer TrainingTrain on one fold with a random split (8 folds in total) or the full dataset using the best parametersRanger optimizer with 60% flat and 40% cosine annealing learning rate schedule.A 4-layer, 256 hidden-size, 512 intermediate-size transformer were trained.A 3-layer model was initialized with 4-layer model's first 3 layers. Knowledge distillation were used in 3-layer model training, in which the 4-layer model is the teacher.3.3 Hyperparameter TuningSince we trained only one fold and used smaller models, we decided to tune most parameters with Optuna. Here is the parameters list of CNN training (transformer training has a similar param-list):All augmentations probabilities (0.1 - 0.5+)Learning rate (2e-3 - 3e-3)Drop out (0.1 - 0.25)Num of epochs (170-185)Loss weights powers (0.75 - 2)Optimizer (Lookahead_RAdam, RAdam)Label smoothing (0.5 - 0.7)4. Submissions, Conversion and EnsembleWe rewrote all our models in Keras and transferred PyTorch weights to them, resulting in a speed boost of around 30%. For transformer model, pytorch-onnx-tf-tflite will generate too much useless tensor shape operations, a fully rewriting can reduce these manually. For CNN model, we rewrote DepthwiseConv2D with a hard-coded way, whose speed is 200%~300% of its original version of tflite DepthwiseConv2D.After that, we aggregated all these models in the tf.Module class. Converting directly from Keras resulted in lower speed (don't know why).We calculated ensemble weights for models trained on fold 0 using the local fold 0 score and applied these weights to the full dataset models.EfficientNet-B0 achieved a leaderboard score of approximately 0.8, and transformers improved the score to 0.81. The final ensemble included:Efficientnet-B0, fold 0BERT, full data trainDeBERTa, full data trainInterestingly, a key feature was using the ensemble without softmax, which consistently provided a boost of around 0.01.5. PS. Need BETTER TFlite DepthwiseConv2DDepthwise convolution models performed very well for these tasks, outperforming other CNN and ViT models (rexnet_100 was also good).We spent a lot of time dealing with the conversion of DepthwiseConv2D operation. Here are some strange results:Given a input image with 82x42x32 (HWC), there are two ways to do a 3x3 depthwise convolution in Keras. One is Conv2D(32, 3, groups = 32), the other is DepthwiseConv2D(3). However, after converting these two to tflite, the running time of the Conv2D is 5.05ms, and the running time of DepthwiseConv2D is 3.70ms. More strangely, a full convolution Conv2D(32, 3, groups = 1) with FLOPs = HWC^2 only takes 2.09ms, even faster than previous two with FLOPs = HWC.Then we rewrote the depthwise-conv like this:     ():        out = x[:,:self.H_out:self.strides,:self.W_out:self.strides] * self.weight[,]         i  (self.kernel_size):             j  (self.kernel_size):                 i ==   j == :                                    out += x[:,i:self.H_out + i:self.strides,j:self.W_out + j:self.strides] * self.weight[i,j]         self.bias   :            out = out + self.bias         outThe running time of this is 1.24 ms.In summary, our version (1.24ms) &gt; full Conv2D with larger FLOPs (2.09ms) &gt; DepthwiseConv2D (3.70ms) &gt; Conv2D(C, groups = C) (5.05ms).However, our version introduced too much nodes in tflite graph, which is not stable in running time. If the tensorflow team has a better implementation of DepthwiseConv2D, we can even ensemble two CNN models, which is expected to reach 0.82 LB.By the way, EfficientNet with ONNX was ~5 times faster than TFLite.Big thanks to my teammates @artemtprv and @carnozhao and congrats with new tiers, Master and GrandMaster!github code",Retell this as a bone-chilling encounter.,"The text you provided describes a bone-chilling encounter with a complex and challenging task.

4199,"Hi!(Bagging) Bootstrap aggregating and boosting are examples of ensembles. An ensemble is the use of several different models in order to increase the quality of the predictions. Why do we use ensembles? Because they improve the quality of our predictions. Why do they increase the quality of our predictions? And that depends on the particular ensemble. In general, we can cite heuristics as well - it's better to ask several different experts and average their answer.Now about the algorithms themselves.Bagging. The algorithm implies building N trees, and the sample for each new tree is sampled from the whole set of objects with repeat (that's why it is a bootstrap). Features are also sampled, that is, each tree sees only a subsample of objects and a subsample of features. Each tree then predicts and the final answer is averaged. The most famous implamentation is sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestBoosting. In contrast to the previous example, in boosting the value of models in the ensemble is unequal. Trees are constructed sequentially so as to reduce the error on each sample object. The most popular type of boosting is gradient boosting. It should be noted that at the moment gradient boostings are the kings of tabular data and show the best results (they are also times faster than neural networks).

4204,"TLDRWe used an approach similar to audio spectrogram classification using the EfficientNet-B0 model, with numerous augmentations and transformer models such as BERT and DeBERTa as helper models. The final solution consists of one EfficientNet-B0 with an input size of 160x80, trained on a single fold from 8 randomly split folds, as well as DeBERTa and BERT trained on the full dataset. A single fold model using EfficientNet has a CV score of 0.898 and a leaderboard score of ~0.8.We used only competition data.1. Data Preprocessing1.1 CNN PreprocessingWe extracted 18 lip points, 20 pose points (including arms, shoulders, eyebrows, and nose), and all hand points, resulting in a total of 80 points.During training, we applied various augmentations.We implemented standard normalization.Instead of dropping NaN values, we filled them with zeros after normalization.We interpolated the time axis to a size of 160 using 'nearest' interpolation: yy = F.interpolate(yy[None, None, :], size=self.new_size, mode='nearest').Finally, we obtained a tensor with dimensions 160x80x3, where 3 represents the (X, Y, Z) axes. 1.2 Transformer PreprocessingOnly 61 points were kept, including 40 lip points and 21 hand points. For left and right hand, the one with less NaN was kept. If right hand was kept, mirror it to left hand.Augmentations, normalization and NaN-filling were applied sequentially.Sequences longer than 96 were interpolated to 96. Sequences shorter than 96 were unchanged.Apart from raw positions, hand-crafted features were also used, including motion, distances, and cosine of angles.Motion features consist of future motion and history motion, which can be denoted as:$$  Motion_{future} = position_{t+1} - position_{t}$$$$  Motion_{history} = position_{t} - position_{t-1}$$Full 210 pairwise distances among 21 hand points were included. There are 5 vertices in a finger (e.g. thumb is [0,1,2,3,4]), and therefore, there are 3 angles: &lt;0,1,2&gt;, &lt;1,2,3&gt;, &lt;2,3,4&gt;. So 15 angles of 5 fingers were included.Randomly selected 190 pairwise distances and randomly selected 8 angles among 40 lip points were included.2. Augmentation2.1 Common Augmentations  These augmentations are used in both CNN training and transformer trainingRandom affine: Same as @hengck23 shared. In CNN, after global affine, shift-scale-rotate was also applied to each part separately (e.g. hand, lip, body-pose).Random interpolation: Slightly scale and shift the time dimension.Flip pose: Flip the x-coordinates of all points. In CNN, x_new = x_max - x_old. In transformer, x_new = 2 * frame[:,0,0] - x_old.Finger tree rotate: There are 4 root-children pairs in a finger with 5-vertices. E.g. in thumb ([0,1,2,3,4]), these 4 root-children pairs are: 0-[1,2,3,4],1-[2,3,4],2-[3,4],3-[4]. We randomly choose some of these pairs, and rotate the children points around root point with a small random angle.2.2 CNN Specific AugmentationsMixup: Implement basic mixup augmentation (only works with CNNs, not transformers).Replace augmentation: Replace some random parts from other samples of the same class.Time and frequence masking: This basic torchaudio augmentation works exceptionally well.freq_m = torchaudio.transforms.FrequencyMasking()  time_m = torchaudio.transforms.TimeMasking()       2.3 Augmented Sample ExampleBefore augmentation: After augmentation:  3. Training3.1 CNN TrainingTrain on one fold with a random split (8 folds in total) or the full dataset using the best parametersOnecycle scheduler with 0.1 warmup.Use weighted CrossEntropyLoss. Increase the weights for poorly predicted classes and classes with semantically similar pairs (such as kitty and cat)Implement a hypercolumn for EfficientNet with 5 blocks3.2 Transformer TrainingTrain on one fold with a random split (8 folds in total) or the full dataset using the best parametersRanger optimizer with 60% flat and 40% cosine annealing learning rate schedule.A 4-layer, 256 hidden-size, 512 intermediate-size transformer were trained.A 3-layer model was initialized with 4-layer model's first 3 layers. Knowledge distillation were used in 3-layer model training, in which the 4-layer model is the teacher.3.3 Hyperparameter TuningSince we trained only one fold and used smaller models, we decided to tune most parameters with Optuna. Here is the parameters list of CNN training (transformer training has a similar param-list):All augmentations probabilities (0.1 - 0.5+)Learning rate (2e-3 - 3e-3)Drop out (0.1 - 0.25)Num of epochs (170-185)Loss weights powers (0.75 - 2)Optimizer (Lookahead_RAdam, RAdam)Label smoothing (0.5 - 0.7)4. Submissions, Conversion and EnsembleWe rewrote all our models in Keras and transferred PyTorch weights to them, resulting in a speed boost of around 30%. For transformer model, pytorch-onnx-tf-tflite will generate too much useless tensor shape operations, a fully rewriting can reduce these manually. For CNN model, we rewrote DepthwiseConv2D with a hard-coded way, whose speed is 200%~300% of its original version of tflite DepthwiseConv2D.After that, we aggregated all these models in the tf.Module class. Converting directly from Keras resulted in lower speed (don't know why).We calculated ensemble weights for models trained on fold 0 using the local fold 0 score and applied these weights to the full dataset models.EfficientNet-B0 achieved a leaderboard score of approximately 0.8, and transformers improved the score to 0.81. The final ensemble included:Efficientnet-B0, fold 0BERT, full data trainDeBERTa, full data trainInterestingly, a key feature was using the ensemble without softmax, which consistently provided a boost of around 0.01.5. PS. Need BETTER TFlite DepthwiseConv2DDepthwise convolution models performed very well for these tasks, outperforming other CNN and ViT models (rexnet_100 was also good).We spent a lot of time dealing with the conversion of DepthwiseConv2D operation. Here are some strange results:Given a input image with 82x42x32 (HWC), there are two ways to do a 3x3 depthwise convolution in Keras. One is Conv2D(32, 3, groups = 32), the other is DepthwiseConv2D(3). However, after converting these two to tflite, the running time of the Conv2D is 5.05ms, and the running time of DepthwiseConv2D is 3.70ms. More strangely, a full convolution Conv2D(32, 3, groups = 1) with FLOPs = HWC^2 only takes 2.09ms, even faster than previous two with FLOPs = HWC.Then we rewrote the depthwise-conv like this:     ():        out = x[:,:self.H_out:self.strides,:self.W_out:self.strides] * self.weight[,]         i  (self.kernel_size):             j  (self.kernel_size):                 i ==   j == :                                    out += x[:,i:self.H_out + i:self.strides,j:self.W_out + j:self.strides] * self.weight[i,j]         self.bias   :            out = out + self.bias         outThe running time of this is 1.24 ms.In summary, our version (1.24ms) &gt; full Conv2D with larger FLOPs (2.09ms) &gt; DepthwiseConv2D (3.70ms) &gt; Conv2D(C, groups = C) (5.05ms).However, our version introduced too much nodes in tflite graph, which is not stable in running time. If the tensorflow team has a better implementation of DepthwiseConv2D, we can even ensemble two CNN models, which is expected to reach 0.82 LB.By the way, EfficientNet with ONNX was ~5 times faster than TFLite.Big thanks to my teammates @artemtprv and @carnozhao and congrats with new tiers, Master and GrandMaster!github code",Revise this into a prophecy.,"The final solution consists of an ensemble of models, including one EfficientNet-B0 with an input size of 160x80, trained on a single fold from 8 randomly split folds, as well as DeBERTa and BERT trained on the full dataset.The ensemble achieved a leaderboard score of approximately 0.8, with a single fold model using EfficientNet having a CV score of 0.898.The key features"

4225,"Our team were created quite late, nevertheless we've managed to create 5  common folds and train bunch of models on them.The original plan was to train a second-level model, but we haven't enough time for that after all.In my opinion, this is the heaviest competition in the terms of hardware used so far (our team has used over 40 GPUs in total).Here is the list of the models we've trained with corresponding dice scores.All the networks have been trained on full resolution images. Valeriy Babushkin (VENHEADs)Valery used custom-built U-Net based on keras framework with different optimizers (Adam, RMSProb, SGD).Due to the limited batch size that can be fitted on one GPU he replaced BatchNorm layer with renormaliztion one.Artur Kuzin (n01z3)My solution is based on mxnet.In my opinion, it was crucial to use some multi-GPU framework what mxnet fits and the latter is also fast enough what is the bonus.However the deconvolution layer in mxnet realization is rather strange therefore I wasn‚Äôt able to reproduce the LinkNet architecture straight from the articleand had to invent something to fit the layers‚Äô shapes from hairy resnet graph.Nevertheless in spite of all the tricks (custom loss, different optimizers, hard negative sampling) had been done,I haven‚Äôt succeeded with training models to the heights on a par with my teammates‚Äô models.Evgeny Nizhibitsky (nizhib)Evgeny made the best models of our ensemble with pytorch.After digging into and translating some arXiv articlesinto the code, he've discovered that LinkNet does very well in this competition.Thus he decided to create some mutated forms of LinkNet using other architectures as an encoder.As a result we've got ""incnet"" ‚Äî inception-v3 + linknet decoders and ""dinknet"" ‚Äî densenet +the same decoders. Evgeny used Adam with inital LR=1e-4 and several lr drops at fixed steps.Roman Trusov (lextal)Roman has trained some modified versions of pspnet with pytorch.He replaced a single deconvolutional layer of the original network with 3 intermediate layerswith consistent size increases.

This seems like it would cause arbitrary issues with capturing the full call or song sequences. What is the reasoning for not doing analysis on the spectrogram of the full audio clip?I have at least one guess for why we need to chop into chunks:      Images may be different sizes due to differing lengths or the patterns will get distorted if we try to make all the images the same size.

This tool features a simple, Pythonic interface and automatic encoding conversion to make it easy to work with website data. This library provides simple methods and Pythonic idioms for navigating, searching, and modifying a parse tree, and automatically converts incoming documents to Unicode and outgoing documents to UTF-8. Scrapy VS Beautiful SoupStructureScrapy is an open-source framework, whereas Beautiful Soup is a Python library designed for quick turnaround projects like screen-scraping. A framework inverts the control of the program and informs the developer what they need. Whereas in the case of a library, the developer calls the library where and when they need it.PerformanceDue to the built-in support for generating feed exports in multiple formats, as well as selecting and extracting data from various sources, the performance of Scrapy can be said to be faster than Beautiful Soup. Working with Beautiful Soup can speed up with the help of Multithreading process.ExtensibilityBeautiful Soup works best when working on smaller projects. On the other hand, Scrapy may be the better choice for larger projects with more complexities, as this framework can add custom functionalities and can develop pipelines with flexibility and speed.  Beginner-FriendlyFor a beginner who is trying hands-on web scraping for the first time, Beautiful Soup is the best choice to start with. Scrapy can be used for scraping, but it is comparatively more complex than the former. CommunityThe developer‚Äôs community of Scrapy is stronger and vast compared to that of Beautiful Soup.

If I may suggest a few pointers:1) Maybe consider including specific examples of companies, organisations that use AI for each of the media, film, education sectors. This could help make these sections more impactful.2) Try including charts, bar graphs etc depicting some summary statistics. You have mentioned having floated a google form. Maybe present results from the form in some sort of chart? I think this would add a lot of value to your essay. Plus the essay grading rubric specifically mentions supplementary materials.

4495,"I plotted the LB data and noticed there is a very steep drop from above 1300 down to 1120, then from 1120 to 1110 becomes a nearly flat slope, from 1110 to 1100 the slope becomes a little bit steeper but below 1100 becomes a sudden drop.  My understanding is it requires different skills to archive different level scores:We need to select the right model to get closer to 1120 (XGB of course), then need to know how to tune the model and cross validate to get to 1110, then need stacking or ensemble to get into below 1110 area. But please notice the significant drop below 1100. How can they get there? I believe those guys must doing something special. As a new learner in my first competition, I have learnt quite a lot from the kernels and currently I'm trying to see if I can come up with some new idea to push ahead a little bit.
