"Ten months after the Supreme Court passed a landmark case on gay marriage, a backlash against the ruling is spreading across the country.Thirty-four states are considering new bills that would protect Christians from the threat of legal action because they object to gay marriage on religious grounds.It's shaping up to be a fierce debate as gay activists and people of faith battle for their rights to be protected.Business owners Dick and Betty Odgaards' story should serve as a warning of what happens when so-called religious freedom laws are not in place to protect people of faith.On August 3, 2013, a gay couple asked the Odgaards if they could rent their gallery in Iowa for a same-sex wedding.""They came in, and Dick was there, and he was the one who had to deliver the bad news to them,"" Betty recalled.The Odgaards refused, citing their Christian belief that marriage should be between one man and one woman.""I don't want to celebrate my sins. I don't want other people to celebrate my sins, nor do I want to participate in celebrating anybody else's sins,"" Richard said.The gay couple sued them for discrimination and after a two-year court battle, rather than celebrate gay marriages, the Christian couple paid the couple a fine and agreed to stop hosting weddings at the gallery.""It has been difficult. I won't lie,"" Betty acknowledged. ""It has been the hardest thing we've ever been through and I don't wish it upon anyone.""Their decision cost them dearly. After months of negative publicity, hate mail, death threats and loss of income, the Gortz Haus Gallery went out of business last year.""The ugly continues to come at us, but I wouldn't want to be anywhere else and we would do it all over again the same way because we are in the middle of God's will,"" Betty told CBN News.Since last summer's Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, more than 100 religious freedom bills have been proposed in 34 states to protect Christians and others from the threat of legal action because they object to gay marriage on religious grounds.Take for example the new law just passed in Mississippi.""The Mississippi law says if you believe marriage is the union of one man and one woman, that sex is reserved for marriage and that we are created male and female -- it doesn't say you have to believe those things -- but it says if you do believe those things, we are not going to penalize you if you act on those beliefs,"" explained Dr. Ryan Anderson, a senior fellow with the Washington, D.C-based Heritage Foundation.In Louisiana and Ohio, lawmakers are also proposing measures that protect pastors who refuse to perform same-sex marriages.Anderson said the accusation that these religious freedom laws are discriminatory against gays and lesbians just isn't true.""I think the basic argument here is that we are trying to protect pluralism, we're trying to protect diversity, we're promoting tolerance,"" he said.But some of the laws have been met with fierce opposition from businesses, activists and celebrities.For instance, North Carolina's governor was forced to roll back portions of a controversial new state law after several companies criticized the law and others threatened to stop their businesses in the state.""I think this just shows you that what's taking place is a form of cronyism, it's cultural cronyism,"" Anderson said. ""Big business is using their marketing freedom to deny little businesses and religious people their religious freedom.""What is clear though is that the backlash from last year's Supreme Court decision has brought religious freedom concerns to the forefront this spring.Many Americans believe that the battle over gay rights versus protecting people's religious convictions is just beginning.","Design a museum exhibit layout, featuring sections related to the article's content.",Introduction:**- Briefly explain the Supreme Court case on gay marriage and its impact on the states.- Highlight the backlash against the ruling and the proposed legislation in various states.**2.

"Lawmakers are fuming over claims that Capitol Police officers left their service weapons in bathrooms and other spots across the Capitol complex three times this year.In one instance, a child visiting the Capitol reportedly found a loaded Glock.""The fact that dangerous weapons were left in the open, potentially within reach of the general public, is unacceptable,"" said House Administration Committee Chairwoman Candice Miller, R-Mich., and Ranking Member Robert Brady, D-Pa., in a written statement.Fox News is told lawmakers will have a briefing on the incidents next week.For Washington's embattled security agencies, it's the latest embarrassing episode. The Capitol Police and other agencies already are under scrutiny over the incident last month where a man breached restricted airspace and landed a gyrocopter next to the Capitol.The incidents involving misplaced firearms were detailed in a report being reviewed by the Capitol Police Board.The newspaper Roll Call, which first reported the incidents, said one of the guns -- allegedly left by a member of House Speaker John Boehner's detail in a bathroom in March -- was found by a 7- or 8-year-old child.Another was found stuffed in a restroom stall in the Capitol Visitor's Center in January. It was discovered by a Capitol worker and belonged to a member of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's security detail.Custodial staff located a third weapon two weeks ago at the Capitol Police headquarters.These firearms are Glocks and do not have conventional ""safeties"" on them -- they will fire if the trigger is pulled.The concerns come as congressional officials are closely scrutinizing USCP Chief Kim Dine.

"Donald Trump is surging in new battleground and national polls at a time when Hillary Clinton faces tough questions not only about her health but her sweeping criticism of her Republican opponent’s supporters.Several surveys appear to show the Republican presidential nominee effectively ending, at least for now, a post-convention slump that saw Clinton leading in virtually every swing state. Now, a Monmouth University Poll shows Trump taking a narrow 2-point lead in Nevada; a Bloomberg Politics poll shows Trump leading Clinton by 5 points in Ohio; and new CNN/ORC polls show Trump leading in Florida and Ohio.In the latter survey, Trump leads 46-41 percent among likely voters in Ohio, and 47-44 percent among likely voters in Florida.“We’ve really had a good month,” Trump told Fox News’ “Fox & Friends,” claiming he’s enjoying renewed “enthusiasm” from voters.Clinton, though, plans to return to the campaign trail Thursday afternoon after taking three days off to recover from a bout of pneumonia. While her campaign dispatched high-powered surrogates to the stump in her absence -- including Bill Clinton and President Obama -- the Democratic nominee’s presence could help reset the race once again.The contest remains tight, and the polls are hardly uniform. A Quinnipiac University national poll released Wednesday showed Clinton leading 48-43 percent among likely voters.But that still represents a narrowing of the race since a late-August survey showing Clinton up 10 points.The recent surveys come as Clinton grapples with new controversies on two fronts: Her comment at a Friday fundraiser that half of Trump’s backers are in a “basket of deplorables,” and her campaign’s handling of a health scare on Sunday during a 15th anniversary ceremony honoring victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.Clinton has since expressed regret for her “deplorables” comment, though Trump has called on her to outright retract it. And Clinton’s campaign has sought to answer questions about the former secretary of state's health, after Clinton was seen stumbling at the 9/11 memorial event in New York City.The campaign said she was overheated and dehydrated, and revealed she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. While the incident revived long-simmering questions about her health, the campaign on Wednesday released additional medical details. Dr. Lisa Bardack, Clinton’s physician, said she is “recovering well with antibiotics and rest.”Bardack also said Clinton remains “healthy and fit to serve.”Trump, too, has tried to answer questions about his own health. He discussed the results of a recent physical with TV’s “Dr. Oz,” and told Fox News on Thursday “they were good.” The discussion with “Dr. Oz” will air on his show Thursday.Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign maintains they always knew states like Ohio would be competitive – and they are building out their operation there.The campaign announced that they will open a half-dozen new offices in the state, bringing their total to 54.","Convert the article into a survival guide, using the events or information as a backdrop for survival tips.","The political landscape is shifting rapidly, and the upcoming presidential election is heating up.

"Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton continues to be a dominant force heading into the 2016 presidential election, according to a new CNN/ORC poll . The former secretary of state maintains a broad lead over the field of potential Democratic challengers she could face in a nomination contest and sizable advantages over the leading contenders from the Republican side in general election match-ups.But none of the top candidates in this field gets within 10 points of Hillary Clinton in a series of hypothetical general election matchups.Rand Paul comes closest, with 43% saying they'd be more likely to back him while 54% choose Clinton. The two candidates who currently top the GOP field, Bush and Walker, match up equally against Clinton, with each carrying 40% to her 55%. Huckabee gets 41% to Clinton's 55% and Carson has 40% to Clinton's 56%.Should Warren decide not to get into the race, Clinton stands to benefit more than others, gaining 5 points and holding a 67% to 16% advantage over Biden when Warren's backers are re-allocated to their second-choice candidate. Notably, with Warren out of the race, Clinton surges from 67% support to 74% among Democratic women.And Democrats broadly believe the party's chances to hold the White House in 2016 are strongest with Clinton; 68% say so, while 30% say the party would have a better shot with someone else leading the ticket.Though Clinton's favorability rating has taken a hit recently, her prospects in 2016 appear largely unchanged compared to polls conducted before news broke about her use of a personal email address and home-based server while serving as secretary of state.On the Republican side, Bush leads the pack with 16%, Walker follows at 13%, Paul nearly matches him at 12% and Huckabee holds 10% support. Huckabee's backing has dipped significantly since February, from 16% to 10%, while the others near the top have generally held steady. In single digits, Carson holds 9%, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has 7%, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has 7%. The rest of the field lands below 5%, including 2012 candidates Rick Santorum at 1% and Rick Perry at 4%.Some interesting demographic trends emerge in the GOP numbers: There is something of a gender gap in preferences, with both Walker (17% among men, 9% among women) and Paul (16% among men, 7% among women) doing significantly better with men than women. Younger Republicans are more likely to back Paul than older ones (he has 17% support among Republicans under 50, just 7% among older Republicans).Bush's backing generally holds steady across demographic divides, but he fares better among self-identified Republicans (22%) than independents who lean toward the party (10%), while Paul outperforms among independents (17% compared with 7% among self-identified Republicans).Yet many of the GOP's strongest contenders remain largely unknown. Majorities of Americans haven't yet formed opinions about Scott Walker (58%) or Ben Carson (64%), and about half haven't heard of or don't know about Marco Rubio (48%).Even the best known Republican contender, Jeb Bush, prompts nearly a quarter of Americans to say they're not sure how they feel about him (23%). Republicans themselves have heard a bit more about their party's top potential candidates, but only one merits a majority favorable rating among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents: Mike Huckabee at 57% favorable.The CNN/ORC International poll was conducted by telephone March 13-15 and included interviews with 1,009 adult Americans. For results among the full sample, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. For results among the 450 Republicans or Republican-leaning independents, or among the 466 Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents, it is 4.5 points.","Transform the article into a fantasy tale, with elements of magic or myth intertwined with real events.","In the realm of the emerald hills and ancient forests, where the whispers of myth and reality intertwine, there lived a woman named Hillary Clinton, a force of nature with a heart of gold and a mind sharp as a blade.

"(CNN) A baby who had heart surgery at St. Mary's Medical Center in Florida died Tuesday, at least the ninth infant to pass away after such a procedure since the program opened at the end of 2011.A CNN investigation calculates that from 2011 to 2013, the program had a 12.5% mortality rate for open heart surgeries, which is more than three times the national average.""Why won't they stop?"" asked Nneka Campbell, whose baby daughter, Amelia, died after heart surgery at the hospital.The same day the latest baby died, St. Mary's CEO Davide Carbone wrote a letter to employees about the CNN investigation, which aired Monday night, expressing support for the program and its heart surgeon, Dr. Michael Black.""The patients we serve are afflicted with severe life-threatening conditions, and it is impossible to eliminate the risk of mortality,"" he wrote.The hospital, which is owned by Tenet Healthcare, says CNN did not get the mortality rate right, but won't say what the hospital believes the correct rate is.Last year in April, the Florida Department of Health sent a team of expert heart doctors to St. Mary's to review the children's heart surgery program. The head of the panel, Dr. Jeffrey Jacobs, a professor of cardiac surgery at Johns Hopkins, suggested they stop doing heart surgeries on babies younger than 6 months.The baby who died Tuesday, Davi Ricardo Brandao, was only a few weeks old when he had surgery in March for a severe heart defect called truncus arteriosus, according to his mother, Pautilia Gomes. She said her son needed a second surgery later that month.In April, in response to an inquiry from CNN, St. Mary's spokeswoman Shelly Weiss said a patient with truncus arteriosus at St. Mary's was ""recovering well and the prognosis is good.""Davi never left the hospital and was not quite 2 months old when he died. Gomes posted a picture on her Facebook page of an eye filled with tears and the word ""LUTO,"" which is Portuguese for ""mourning.""According to St. Mary's, the hospital received the experts' final reviews last year in June. In his letter to employees, Carbone said that since that time, ""our mortality rate has been consistent with the national average, and does not significantly exceed the mortality rate of other programs as the CNN story alleges.""He did not say what the hospital's mortality rate was, or whether it included Davi's death. An email from CNN to Weiss went unanswered Wednesday.In his review last year, Jacobs, the Johns Hopkins surgeon, noted that St. Mary's was doing too few pediatric heart surgeries -- a very complex type of operation -- to get good at it. He noted that in 2013, the hospital did 23 procedures. The vast majority of hospitals in the United States that perform these surgeries do more than 100 a year, and anything less than that is considered low volume by the Society for Thoracic Surgeons.In response to CNN's investigation, Florida's Department of Health and the Agency for Health Care Administration issued a statement Wednesday saying, ""Florida does not regulate the number of procedures performed at pediatric cardiac programs"" and that the Agency for Health Care Administration ""continues to closely monitor St. Mary's to ensure that they are following the law.""","Convert the article into a crossword puzzle, with clues derived from the content and themes.",**Crossword Puzzle:****Across:**1.

"THE STING videos targeting Planned Parenthood are hard to watch. Doctors talk clinically, some say callously, about harvesting fetal tissue. Technicians identify and isolate tiny organs. References are made to “it’s a baby” or “it’s another boy.” The videos were taken surreptitiously and were artfully edited to produce maximum discomfort about complicated issues that, for many, are inherently uncomfortable.That truths were distorted to paint an inaccurate and unfair picture of a health organization that provides valuable services to women — as well as to demonize research that leads to important medical advances — doesn’t matter to antiabortion activists. Or, sadly, to the politicians who pander to them.Planned Parenthood is under virulent attack for the role a small portion of its affiliates play in helping women who want to donate fetal tissue for medical research. The antiabortion group Center for Medical Progress has orchestrated a propaganda campaign accusing the nation’s largest provider of abortions of profiting from the illegal sale of fetal tissue, a charge refuted by Planned Parenthood.None of the videos released shows anything illegal and, in fact, the full footage of Planned Parenthood executives meeting with people presumed to be buyers for a human biologics company include repeated assertions that clinics are not selling tissue but only seeking permitted reimbursement costs for expenses. Indeed, the Colorado clinic featured in the videos refused to enter into a contract with the phony company because of its failure to meet its legal and ethical standards.Such facts, though, haven’t stopped officials in several Republican-led states, including Texas, Louisiana and Ohio, from launching investigations of Planned Parenthood, even though affiliates in those states don’t facilitate fetal tissue donations. In Washington, Senate Republicans have fast-tracked a bid to defund Planned Parenthood, with a vote set for Monday. Fortunately, it’s unlikely there will be 60 votes to advance the bill, as cutting off funds to Planned Parenthood would be irresponsible.No federal money is used by Planned Parenthood to provide abortions except in some rare exceptions. So cutting off government funds, mostly through Medicaid and grants, would only hurt the thousands of people, most of them low-income women, who each day depend upon Planned Parenthood for birth control, cancer screenings, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and other health services. Given that many of the clinics are in medically underserved areas, it’s a myth, as Republicans claim, that other providers can fill the gap. Shutting down clinics would make it harder for many women to obtain birth control — and the last thing either side of the abortion debate should want is an increase in unwanted pregnancies that result in more abortions.We are under no illusions that the vendetta against Planned Parenthood will end. Conservative Republicans are already threatening to shut down the federal government in the fall by blocking any spending that includes money for Planned Parenthood. It’s clear from how quickly Republican presidential hopefuls seized on the issue that it will be a staple of the campaign trail. Consequently, it’s important that congressional Democrats and others continue to stand up for Planned Parenthood and the women whose health depends upon its services.",Present the information as a series of Instagram-style photo captions.,"They're clinical, some say callously, about harvesting fetal tissue. It's a sensitive issue, and these videos are artfully edited to produce maximum discomfort.But the truth is, Planned Parenthood provides valuable services to women, including birth control, cancer screenings, and testing for sexually transmitted infections.

"Newly released video captured by an Arizona police officer’s body camera captures the chilling moment when a deranged suspect drew a gun and fired the bullet that killed the officer last month.Rookie Flagstaff Police Officer Tyler Stewart’s camera caught the entire, deadly encounter with Robert Smith, whose girlfriend had called police on Dec. 27 to report he had trashed her apartment. The video, released by the police department in response to Freedom of Information Act requests, begins with Stewart getting out of his squad car and ends with Smith pointing the gun at him and firing.Smith then shot himself dead, and Stewart, who was 24, later died at a hospital.""Officer Stewart was murdered by Smith without any provocation or warning,"" Sgt. Margaret Bentzen told the Arizona Daily Sun. ""There were no homicidal or suicidal indications from Smith prior to the crime.""The frightening, 14-minute video comes as the Justice Department is encouraging police departments around the nation to invest in the body cameras following high-profile cases in which police have been criticized, including last August’s police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.Stewart and Smith speak outside Smith's Flagstaff home on Dec. 27 for about three minutes as Smith stands with his hands in his jacket pockets. When Stewart asks him if he has any weapons on him, Smith replies, “No, sir. I'm just cold,” and says he only has “smokes” in his pocket.Stewart then calmly asks if he can check Smith for weapons. When he reaches toward him, Smith draws a .22-caliber revolver from his right pocket and fires six times at Stewart. Five shots hit Strewart, four in the head and one in the lower back.One of Smith's roommates told police that Smith had been contemplating suicide, according to police reports.Stewart had gone to Smith’s girlfriend’s home earlier, but the man who would later kill him was gone. The cop then went to Smith's home, where his roommate said Smith had fled, according to a police report. Records indicate that about an hour later, at 12.30 p.m., Smith called the Flagstaff Police Department and left a message for Stewart, who then went back to Smith’s home where the fatal encounter took place.“This is an enormous tragedy for our department and the family of our officer,” Flagstaff Police Chief Kevin Treadway told AZ Central. “We are a very close-knit organization, and know that all members of the Flagstaff Police Department are grieving at this time.”Release of the frightening footage raises questions about balancing the public's right to know against privacy concerns of police officers and their families, according to Levi Bolton Jr., executive director of the 14,000-member Arizona Police Association. On Wednesday, Bolton met with state lawmakers to discuss the cameras and how best to handle disclosure of footage that may show innocent bystanders, undercover police or informants or, as in Stewart's case, the final moments of an officer's life.""We are currently crafting or looking at legislation that may very well discuss this,"" Bolton told reporters. ""We acknowledge that the public and the media should have access to this information.""A fund to help Stewart's family has been established and those wishing to donate can do so at any Wells Fargo Bank, according to the Flagstaff Police Department. The account number is 7764473984.","Write a satirical piece, exaggerating the article's themes for comic effect.","It's a scene that would make even the most seasoned cop break a sweat.The footage begins with Stewart getting out of his squad car and walking towards the home of Robert Smith, a man whose girlfriend had called the cops on a minor domestic dispute.

"In what was an emotional and contentious scene at the Rowan County, Ky., Courthouse this morning, one dramatic legal standoff came to an end when a gay couple was issued a marriage license.James Yates and William Smith, who had tried this five times before, arrived at the courthouse just as the sun started peeking out from under the mountains on the horizon.They walked past protesters — some condemning them and some cheering them — and entered the clerk's office.Kim Davis, the county clerk who had stood in their way those five previous attempts, was in jail. She was held in contempt by a federal judge Thursday for refusing to hand out marriage licenses in defiance of the U.S. Supreme Court. So early Friday, Yates and Smith walked up to Deputy Clerk Brian Mason.Mason was all business. He checked their licenses, asked them if they were related, took their $35 and, in about five minutes, handed them an envelope and said, ""Congratulations.""Yates and Smith had become the first same-sex couple to receive a marriage license from Rowan County.They exited to chants of ""Love has won. Love has won.""""I don't want her in jail,"" Yates said of Davis. ""No one wanted her in jail. We just wanted the licenses given out. This isn't a blessing. It's an official license.""""This means, at least for this area, civil rights are civil rights and they're not subject to beliefs.""Davis' husband, Joe Davis, was also outside the courthouse with a group of protesters who called this a moral fight.""We don't hate these people. That's the furthest thing from our hearts,"" he said. ""We don't hate nobody. We just want to have the same rights that they have. They're saying, 'Hey we're gonna make you accept us.' But they don't want to accept our beliefs.

"There’s a conceit that says everything at Facebook is run by data, not people. And we prefer it that way.For the site’s billion users, believing there’s no human puppet master behind the scenes makes its growing control over life more palatable. It’s just a clever machine, reflecting our desires better and better with every interaction, right? For news producers, we have to believe that the platform treats everyone equally: that it’s a publisher not an editor.In retrospect, this was always naive.A conservative whistleblower at Facebook yesterday claimed in a report that the influential “trending news” tab was deliberately biased toward liberal news – something the social network denies.“I’d come on shift and I’d discover that CPAC [Conservative Political Action Conference] or Mitt Romney or Glenn Beck or popular conservative topics wouldn’t be trending because either the curator didn’t recognize the news topic or it was like they had a bias against Ted Cruz,” the former news curator told the tech blog Gizmodo.Silicon Valley loves using the word algorithm to cover the word judgment, but any platform built by humans is always political. The engineers building the products want to skew them toward “quality” content, but it’s hard to determine what quality is, exactly, without making a choice influenced by values.When I read suggestions that Facebook might be skewing its trending bar, my first reaction, as a San Francisco liberal, was to be slightly pleased (any help we can get against Trump, right?). But what if the tables were turned? “I wonder what the psychological effects of it are,” said Vince Coglianese, editor of the conservative news site The Daily Caller. “Millions of Facebook users now have no idea that the things they’re concerned about are the concerns of a lot of people. It’s scary to think Facebook’s intentionally isolating vast swaths of the country.”Facebook’s in a tricky spot because curation is necessary. Truly viral news content tends to be terrible. The front page of Reddit’s ‘”hot” section, an imperfect but useful barometer for the viral stories of the day, currently has headlines like: “Chameleon unsure bug is food or not” and “These condoms are around 60 years old. (found in my basement)”. Meanwhile my Facebook trending bar has: “Federal Trade Commission: Judge Rules Against Agency’s Bid to Block Health Care Systems Merger”. It’s probably fair to assume that the FTC news was not going as viral as that old condom, but a Facebook employee decided it was more important.Facebook is the dominant player in the media today. As news websites lose relevance to readers who find content socially, and as stories are published directly onto Facebook as Instant articles, the company’s power will only grow. To turn Facebook’s trending bar into a Reddit page is not the answer. But Facebook has to be more honest about how it operates as an editor.“Just be transparent about how the words on the screen are getting there,” Coglianese said.If there’s one thing Silicon Valley loves more than the conceit of an amoral algorithm, it is secrecy. And as a social network with a newsfeed of vacation pictures, Facebook could get away with being secretive about their curation.As the most powerful publisher and now editor in the world today, Facebook owes it to its billion users to be clear about how the site plans on distributing news.","Write as an interactive web story, where readers choose how to explore the topic.",It raises important questions about the power of social media platforms and the impact they have on our society.**Here are some potential ways you could explore this topic further:****1.

Still, his comments on the race have seemed to favor his former secretary of state, if only slightly.Jay Carney told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Wednesday that's no accident -- and the President does want Clinton to win.""I don't think there is any doubt that he wants Hillary to win the nomination and believes that she would be the best candidate in the fall and the most effective as president in carrying forward what he's achieved,"" said Carney, a CNN contributor.The White House declined to comment on Carney's comments Wednesday. Carney said Obama won't make an official endorsement until the race is decided, but his intentions are clear.

"After a week of nonstop criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike for comments many condemned as racially charged, Donald Trump claims to be altering his campaign to be a little more inclusive. While the presumptive G.O.P. has long promised to “make America great again,” Trump now says he’s adding two words to slogan to illustrate just how non-racist he really is.“You know, I have the theme ‘make America great again,’ and I've added a couple of things,” Trump announced to supporters at a campaign rally in Richmond, Virginia, on Friday night. “Right now I’m adding make America great again—I’m adding ‘for everyone,’ because it’s really going to be for everyone. It’s not going to be for a group of people, it’s going to be for everyone. It’s true.”The allegedly amended slogan, which has yet to appear on any official signage or Trump merchandise, comes after the presidential candidate spent the first half of June repeatedly denouncing Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge of Mexican heritage presiding over the Trump University class action lawsuit, as inherently biased against him. (Curiel was born in Indiana.) His comments were widely condemned by the Washington political establishment, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who suggested he may be an idiot, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who called Trump’s statement the “textbook definition of a racist comment.”Trump, who hasn’t apologized or taken back any of his comments, indicated on Friday that he realized his words have had a negative effect on his campaign and declared he is not a racist.“I am the least racist person. The least racist person that you’ve ever seen. I mean give me a break,” he said at the rally. “I am the least racist person that you’ve ever looked at, believe me.”","Format as a series of tweets from an expert, offering insights and commentary.","In response to the backlash, Trump has claimed to be altering his campaign to be more inclusive.""You know, I have the theme 'make America great again,' and I've added a couple of things,"" Trump announced at a rally in Richmond, Virginia, on Friday night.

"House Republicans are in chaos after Thursday's political bombshell when Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the handpicked successor to Speaker John Boehner, announced he would not seek the post.The prospects for electing a new speaker have dimmed.

""The one thing I found in talking to everybody -- if we are gonna unite and be strong, we need a new face to help do that.""""The Republican Party has to show it can govern. We can't go on like this. This is insanity,"" he told the Daily News.McCarthy's decision came after a closed-door meeting with the same conservatives who would challenge him on the House floor as speaker.It also came after a letter from Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., calling for the next speaker to be above reproach in his or her personal life.""I know what can happen to a party when you don't demand honesty and integrity in your leadership. I've seen it. I know what can happen,"" Jones told CBN News by phone.CBN News' Jennifer Wishon spoke with Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., about his letter to the Republican Conference Chairman.Two candidates for speaker -- Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla., and Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah -- both say they were shocked by McCarthy's withdrawal.""Our conference is gonna have to do a lot of deep soul searching,"" Chaffetz said. ""And we'll see what happens.""The House speakership is a grueling, often thankless job, something akin to herding cats, and many of the House's brightest stars simply do not want the job.Some are now urging former GOP vice presidential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to throw his hat into the ring, though he still says he's not running.Some are even throwing out the name of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is no longer a member of Congress.

"The Republican Party’s identity crisis keeps getting worse. Hours after House Speaker Paul Ryan said he was not ready to support Donald Trump, the presumptive G.O.P. nominee, 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney also refused to endorse his successor, saying that he was “dismayed” by the state of American politics and that he wished for “better choices” for candidates who, unfortunately, do not exist anymore.While Romney ruled out the possibility of a third-party candidacy during a Q&A at a fundraising gala Thursday night in Washington, he said he was so fundamentally disappointed with the G.O.P. that he could not support Trump in good conscience, nor would he switch allegiances and support Hillary Clinton.“I see way too much demagoguery and populism on both sides of the aisle and I only hope and aspire that we'll see more greatness,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.Earlier this year, Romney championed the Never Trump movement, attempting to block his nomination by proposing the remaining Republican candidates unite to force a contested convention in which an alternative would win the nomination despite winning fewer primaries. That dream ended earlier this week when Ted Cruz dropped out of the race (and John Kasich soon after), but that didn’t stop Romney from sticking to his convictions.“I happen to think that the person who is leading the nation has an enormous and disproportionate impact on the course of the world, so I am dismayed at where we are now,” he said. “I wish we had better choices, and I keep hoping that somehow things will get better, and I just don't see an easy answer from where we are.”Romney also praised Ryan, his former running mate, who recently took on Trump. “He is where he needs to be,” he explained, saying that he was impressed that Ryan could somehow get the wildly fractious House G.O.P. to work together. “I’d love to see him run for president, but having a Speaker of the House, at this stage, where we don’t know what’s going to happen on the presidential race, having a Speaker of the House with that kind of leadership capacity is very encouraging. I have hopes that he’ll remain Speaker.”Romney may not be the first Republican leader to publicly disavow Trump since he became the party’s nominee—that honor goes to Nebraska senator Ben Sasse, who quickly argued that an “adult” step in and run for president on a third-party ticket—but he is by far the most prominent. So far, there have been rumblings within an embarrassed G.O.P. that they could never support Trump: both George H.W. Bush and his son George W. Bush refused to endorse or comment on the nomination, and do not plan on attending the Republican National Convention. Senator John McCain was recorded saying that Trump would severely hurt his re-election chances in Arizona, a Latino-heavy state that borders Mexico. And, as Hillary Clinton highlighted in an e-mail blast, that sentiment isn’t limited to high-profile Republicans, either: dozens of other G.O.P. congressional representatives, governors, and major political figures are all quickly boarding the anti-Trump train—or, at the very least, refusing to comment.","Reimagine the article as a speculative fiction story, incorporating futuristic elements or technology.","Hours after House Speaker Paul Ryan declared his reluctance to support Donald Trump, the presumptive G.O.P. nominee, 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney echoed the sentiment, saying he was ""dismayed"" by the state of American politics and wished for ""better choices.""The once vibrant political landscape had"

"The Senate worked late into the night Friday and early Saturday, but still failed to agree on extending government surveillance programs under the USA Patriot Act before the Memorial Day holiday.Lawmakers blocked votes on both a House-passed bill and a short-term extension of the Patriot Act provisions that allow government surveillance programs.Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says lawmakers will try again on May 31, the day before the provisions expire.The Senate first took up the House bill, which would end the National Security Agency's bulk collection of domestic phone records. That bill, passed overwhelmingly by the House and supported by the Obama administration, required a 60-vote majority to proceed. It fell three votes short.The Senate then failed to advance a two-month extension of the expiring Patriot Act provision that would extend the NSA phone records program. That vote was seven short of the required 69 votes, reports NPR Washington desk senior editor Shirley Henry.Sen. Majority Leader McConnell tried to secure unanimous consent agreements on a number of measures aimed at preventing the program from lapsing on June 1, when the Patriot Act provision expires, Henry reports.McConnell first proposed a measure to extend the act to June 8. But Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican presidential contender, objected, saying he wants two amendments debated and voted on.""Our forefathers would be aghast,"" Paul said.Henry reports that McConnell then tried for an extension to June 5, but there was an objection. His proposal for June 3 met another objection; then Paul objected to a June 2 extension, Henry says.Unable to get agreement on any extension, McConnell said the Senate will come back at 4 p.m. on May 31 to try again, beginning with a vote on the House bill. That gives lawmakers only a few hours to prevent the Patriot Act provisions from expiring.The majority leader stressed that it's a dangerous time to allow the law to expire, given the threats overseas and attempted attacks here, and urged the Senate to act ""responsibly"" to protect the country, Henry reports.The Justice Department has said the NSA would begin winding down collection of domestic phone records this week if the Senate failed to act, according to the Associated Press.","Compose the article as a time capsule entry, capturing the current state or events for future generations.","Despite working late into the night and early Saturday, lawmakers were unable to reach an agreement on both a House-passed bill and a short-term extension.The main obstacle to agreement was the Senate's requirement for a 60-vote majority to pass the House bill, which would end the National Security Agency's bulk collection of domestic"
"Not all the claims in the vice presidential debate stand up to scrutiny. A look at some of them and how they compare with the facts:REPUBLICAN MIKE PENCE: ""The fact that under this past administration, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious.... Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same.""THE FACTS: As a share of the total U.S. economy, the national debt has gone up 35 percent; not a doubling.Still, the debt has ballooned to $19.6 trillion. This largely reflected efforts by the Obama administration to stop the Great Recession.Would Clinton similarly increase the debt? Not according to an analysis by the independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.The Clinton plan with its tax increases would increase the gross debt -- both privately and publicly held-- by $450 billion over 10 years. Mind you, that is on top of an $8.8 trillion increase already projected by the government under current law.As for Donald Trump, the committee says his tax-cut-heavy plan would increase the gross debt by $4.3 trillion --nearly 10 times more than Clinton's plan would do.DEMOCRAT TIM KAINE, on fighting the Islamic State: ""Donald Trump doesn't have a plan.""THE FACTS: Clinton also doesn't have a plan that is materially different than what President Barack Obama is already doing.She's described a three-part strategy that involves crushing IS ""on its home turf"" in the Middle East, disrupting its infrastructure on the ground and online, and protecting America and its allies. All are current elements of the Obama administration's strategy, so it's not clear what would change or if she would accelerate any portions of it.It's also the case that Trump has not laid out a clear plan.PENCE, calling Clinton the ""architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy,"" says the crisis in Syria was the result of a ""failed and weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead.""THE FACTS: Clinton, as secretary of state, actually pushed for increased U.S. intervention after Syrian President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons against rebels. But Obama is the commander in chief and nothing has swayed him thus far. Whatever her failings might be on foreign policy, it's a stretch to accuse her of helping to lead a weak policy on Syria.PENCE: ""We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal.""THE FACTS: The coal industry's woes don't come solely from onerous federal regulations. Pence omitted the effects of steep competition from cheap natural gas.A string of major coal companies have filed for bankruptcy in recent years, including Arch Coal, Alpha Natural Resources and Peabody Energy. Layoffs and cutbacks have spread economic suffering through coal country in the Appalachians and Wyoming's Powder River Basin. By contrast, these are boom times for natural gas extraction, mostly due to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.Still, the Obama administration has implemented rules that aren't making the coal industry's life any easier. Obama last year imposed a rule requiring coal-fired power plants to cut their carbon emissions as part of his effort to combat climate change. The rule has been suspended pending a legal challenge. Obama also has halted new coal leases on federal lands until it completes a comprehensive review.PENCE, saying he's proud that ""the state of Indiana has balanced budgets.""THE FACTS: True, but that's not exactly to his credit as governor of Indiana. A balanced budget is required by law, as it is in every state except Vermont.","Transform the article into a board of directors' report, analyzing the story's events in a corporate context.","**Key Points:****National Debt:**- Republican Mike Pence claims that the national debt has doubled under the Obama administration.

"There were several reports this month, based on former and current aides, that Mitt Romney is actively weighing another presidential run. The biggest sign yet comes from a recent interview with The New York Times, where the former 2012 Republican nominee offered a less than Shermanesque response to the million-dollar question.This was the obvious opening for me to ask if there was a chance. Romney's response was decidedly meta — ""I have nothing to add to the story"" -- but he then fell into the practiced political parlance of nondenial. ""We've got a lot of people looking at the race,"" he said. ""We'll see what happens.""Buoyed by good poll numbers and a wide-open prospective Republican field, Romney went farther than his ""circumstances can change"" reply in August, and certainly miles forward from the, ""Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no,"" answer in January.If he does throw his hat into the ring for a third time, the former governor of Massachusetts told the Times that he would employ a cameraman -- essentially his own tracker -- to follow him around in order to guard against statements that derailed his 2012 campaign. ""I want to be reminded that this is not off the cuff,"" Romney said.Romney said the tactic could potentially prevent another ""47 percent"" incident, which by his telling, was nothing more than a problem of setting.""My mistake was that I was speaking in a way that reflected back to the man,"" Romney said. ""If I had been able to see the camera, I would have remembered that I was talking to the whole world, not just the man.""","Conceive as a children's book story, simplifying complex ideas into engaging narratives.","He has been actively weighing his options and has recently offered a less than Shermanesque response to the million-dollar question.In a recent interview with The New York Times, Romney said that he has ""nothing to add to the story"" but also hinted that he is interested in the race.

"SHARM EL-SHEIK, Egypt, March 14 (Reuters) - On the eve of fresh talks with Iran, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said it was unclear whether an interim agreement over its nuclear power program was within reach.""I can't tell you whether or not we can get a deal, whether we are close,"" Kerry told a news conference on Saturday in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik, where he attended an Egyptian investment summit.""The purpose of these negotiations is not just to get a deal, it is to get the right deal,"" he added.The United States and five other major powers -- Britain, Germany, France, China and Russia -- will resume negotiations with Iran in Lausanne, Switzerland, from Sunday. They hope to clinch a framework agreement by the end of the month.The two sides would then seek to negotiate by June 30 a final agreement to would curb Iran's most sensitive nuclear activities for at least 10 years. In exchange, sanctions on the Islamic Republic would gradually end.Kerry expressed concern again that a letter to Iran last week from Republican senators may have undermined the talks. The letter warned Iran that any deal made by President Barack Obama might last only as long as he remained in office -- a highly unusual intervention in U.S. foreign policy-making.Kerry said he would assure Iranian negotiators and Europeans allies during the upcoming talks that Congress did not have the authority to change the deal.""As far as we're concerned, Congress has no ability to change an executive agreement,"" Kerry said, adding that ""important gaps"" still remained between the sides.The letter followed a speech to Congress earlier this month by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who warned that Obama was negotiating a ""bad deal"" with Iran. Republicans invited Netanyahu to speak about Iran without consulting the White House or Democrats.With Israel preparing to elect a new government next week, Kerry said the United States hoped that whatever the outcome it would help push forward the peace process with Palestinians.""President Obama remains committed to a two-state solution,"" Kerry said, adding ""he remains hopeful that whatever choice that people of Israel make, that there will be an ability to be able to move forward on those efforts.""He declined to elaborate on the prospects of resuming the talks, with an election just days away.Peace talks broke down in April 2014 after nine months of negotiations led by Kerry, with the long-standing goal of a two-state solution no closer.Abbas has steered clear of taking a position on the Israeli election, saying only that he was ready to work with who wins.

"THE STING videos targeting Planned Parenthood are hard to watch. Doctors talk clinically, some say callously, about harvesting fetal tissue. Technicians identify and isolate tiny organs. References are made to “it’s a baby” or “it’s another boy.” The videos were taken surreptitiously and were artfully edited to produce maximum discomfort about complicated issues that, for many, are inherently uncomfortable.That truths were distorted to paint an inaccurate and unfair picture of a health organization that provides valuable services to women — as well as to demonize research that leads to important medical advances — doesn’t matter to antiabortion activists. Or, sadly, to the politicians who pander to them.Planned Parenthood is under virulent attack for the role a small portion of its affiliates play in helping women who want to donate fetal tissue for medical research. The antiabortion group Center for Medical Progress has orchestrated a propaganda campaign accusing the nation’s largest provider of abortions of profiting from the illegal sale of fetal tissue, a charge refuted by Planned Parenthood.None of the videos released shows anything illegal and, in fact, the full footage of Planned Parenthood executives meeting with people presumed to be buyers for a human biologics company include repeated assertions that clinics are not selling tissue but only seeking permitted reimbursement costs for expenses. Indeed, the Colorado clinic featured in the videos refused to enter into a contract with the phony company because of its failure to meet its legal and ethical standards.Such facts, though, haven’t stopped officials in several Republican-led states, including Texas, Louisiana and Ohio, from launching investigations of Planned Parenthood, even though affiliates in those states don’t facilitate fetal tissue donations. In Washington, Senate Republicans have fast-tracked a bid to defund Planned Parenthood, with a vote set for Monday. Fortunately, it’s unlikely there will be 60 votes to advance the bill, as cutting off funds to Planned Parenthood would be irresponsible.No federal money is used by Planned Parenthood to provide abortions except in some rare exceptions. So cutting off government funds, mostly through Medicaid and grants, would only hurt the thousands of people, most of them low-income women, who each day depend upon Planned Parenthood for birth control, cancer screenings, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and other health services. Given that many of the clinics are in medically underserved areas, it’s a myth, as Republicans claim, that other providers can fill the gap. Shutting down clinics would make it harder for many women to obtain birth control — and the last thing either side of the abortion debate should want is an increase in unwanted pregnancies that result in more abortions.We are under no illusions that the vendetta against Planned Parenthood will end. Conservative Republicans are already threatening to shut down the federal government in the fall by blocking any spending that includes money for Planned Parenthood. It’s clear from how quickly Republican presidential hopefuls seized on the issue that it will be a staple of the campaign trail. Consequently, it’s important that congressional Democrats and others continue to stand up for Planned Parenthood and the women whose health depends upon its services.",Convert into a dialogue between two people with opposing views on the subject.,"They provide a clear and concise view of the callous and inhumane practice of harvesting fetal tissue. It is undeniable that these videos depict a barbaric and unethical procedure that should be outlawed.**Person 2:**While I understand the concerns raised about the videos, I believe that they have been misconstrued and manipulated to create a false narrative. The videos do not show any"
"In a marketing fiasco that could rank right up there with “New Coke,” Starbucks has ditched its plan to have baristas ignite a national discussion on race after critics advised the chain its view of black and white should revolve around coffee and milk.The baristas had begun writing ""Race Together"" on customers' cups, as a means of starting a conversation with customers, but the practice ended Sunday after just one week, said company spokesman Jim Olson. But the chain's initiative will continue more broadly without the handwritten messages, Starbucks spokesman Jim Olson said.The cups were always ""just the catalyst"" for a larger conversation and Starbucks will still hold forum discussions, co-produce special sections in USA Today and put more stores in minority communities as part of the Race Together initiative, according to a company memo from CEO Howard Schultz said.The campaign has been criticized as opportunistic and inappropriate, coming in the wake of racially charged events such as national protests over police killings of black males. Others questioned whether Starbucks workers could spark productive conversations about race while serving drinks.The critics blasted Corey duBrowa, the company's senior vice president of global communications, on Twitter after the plan was first announced, calling it patronizing at best and inflammatory at worst. The executive was forced to delete his Twitter account, although he re-activated it the next day.“Last night I felt personally attacked in a cascade of negativity,” he tweeted. “I got overwhelmed by the volume and tenor of the discussion, and I reacted.”The phase-out is not a reaction to that pushback, Olson said. ""Nothing is changing. It's all part of the cadence of the timeline we originally planned.""He echoed the company memo, saying of the Race Together initiative, ""We're leaning into it hard.""Schultz's note acknowledged the skeptics as an anticipated part of the outreach.""While there has been criticism of the initiative -- and I know this hasn't been easy for any of you -- let me assure you that we didn't expect universal praise,"" it read.He said the campaign at its core aims to make sure that ""the promise of the American Dream should be available to every person in this country, not just a select few.""The Associated Press contributed to this report.",Present the information as a series of Instagram-style photo captions.,".. well, let's just say it's not exactly what I expected from a cup of coffee at Starbucks.""**Photo 2:**""The 'Race Together' initiative was a good idea in theory, but it didn't exactly go as planned.

"Lawmakers are fuming over claims that Capitol Police officers left their service weapons in bathrooms and other spots across the Capitol complex three times this year.In one instance, a child visiting the Capitol reportedly found a loaded Glock.""The fact that dangerous weapons were left in the open, potentially within reach of the general public, is unacceptable,"" said House Administration Committee Chairwoman Candice Miller, R-Mich., and Ranking Member Robert Brady, D-Pa., in a written statement.Fox News is told lawmakers will have a briefing on the incidents next week.For Washington's embattled security agencies, it's the latest embarrassing episode. The Capitol Police and other agencies already are under scrutiny over the incident last month where a man breached restricted airspace and landed a gyrocopter next to the Capitol.The incidents involving misplaced firearms were detailed in a report being reviewed by the Capitol Police Board.The newspaper Roll Call, which first reported the incidents, said one of the guns -- allegedly left by a member of House Speaker John Boehner's detail in a bathroom in March -- was found by a 7- or 8-year-old child.Another was found stuffed in a restroom stall in the Capitol Visitor's Center in January. It was discovered by a Capitol worker and belonged to a member of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's security detail.Custodial staff located a third weapon two weeks ago at the Capitol Police headquarters.These firearms are Glocks and do not have conventional ""safeties"" on them -- they will fire if the trigger is pulled.The concerns come as congressional officials are closely scrutinizing USCP Chief Kim Dine.

"Washington One week after we moved Nevada and Florida from ""battleground"" to ""lean Democratic,"" both states appear to be snapping back to their traditional toss-up status. Our new CNN electoral outlook places both states back in the ""battleground"" category and increases the up-for-grabs turf to six states and two congressional districts worth a total of 87 electoral votes.Note: The split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines.Clinton had not yet finished her two-day swing through the Sunshine State before her campaign let it be known that she would be back in Florida this weekend.Florida is also one of the handful of states where the Clinton campaign remains heavily on the air with campaign advertising and where it announced today that two closing argument ads will begin to be seen across the state.Florida's 29 electoral votes are the biggest prize on the map among competitive states and both campaigns plan to fight it out there all the way through November 8.In Nevada, polls continue to show it is a margin-of-error race between Clinton and Trump and both candidates are expected back in the Silver State before Election Day.As Trump continues to shore up his Republican support and improve his standing among Hispanics (though still losing this group by a wide margin), he is ensuring Nevada remains competitive all the way through Election Day.With the new changes to the CNN electoral outlook, our current snapshot has Clinton at 272 electoral votes from states either solidly or leaning in her direction. Trump has a total of 179 electoral votes from the states either solidly or leaning in his direction. That leaves 87 electoral votes currently up for grabs in the remaining battleground states.The full rundown is below:California (55), Connecticut (7), Delaware (3), DC (3), Hawaii (4), Illinois (20), Maine (3), Maryland (10), Massachusetts (11), New Jersey (14), New York (29), Oregon (7), Rhode Island (4), Vermont (3), Washington (12), Minnesota (10), New Mexico (5) (200 total)","Transform the article into a treasure map, leading to insights or conclusions hidden within the story.","**The map:**- The map is divided into states, with the number of electoral votes for each state listed below the state name.- The states are divided into two categories: ""solidly"" or ""leaning"" in a particular candidate's direction, and ""battleground"" states.- The battleground states"
"House Republicans are in chaos after Thursday's political bombshell when Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the handpicked successor to Speaker John Boehner, announced he would not seek the post.The prospects for electing a new speaker have dimmed.

"Employers aren’t dropping their health benefits in the numbers once anticipated, and programs created by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will be slower to reach full enrollment than the budget office expects, the Department of Health and Human Services said today in a report. That equates to between 9 million and 9.9 million people enrolled through new government-run insurance markets created by the law.Coming in below the CBO estimate would undermine the Obama administration’s effort to convince the public that its signature domestic policy initiative is working. It’s possible the administration is just giving itself an easier goal to beat, said Dan Mendelson, the chief executive officer of Avalere Health, a Washington consulting firm.“If you set low expectations, you’re less likely to disappoint,” he said. “To me, these are low expectations. We expect the numbers to come in higher.”The insurance markets, called exchanges, are designed to allow people who don’t have coverage through an employer to compare prices and buy a health plan, often with the assistance of government subsidies for monthly premiums. Enrollment opens for 2015 on Nov. 15 and closes Feb. 15, a window that is three months shorter than last year.Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the HHS secretary, said she’ll consider enrollment to be a success this year if the U.S. uninsured rate continues to decline. About 13.4 percent of Americans are without coverage this year, according to Gallup Inc., the lowest rate the organization has reported since it started tracking the figure in 2008.“We want to make progress on that fundamental number of reducing the uninsured,” Burwell said at an event held by the Center for American Progress, a Democrat-aligned advocacy group. “We do have a shorter period of time and we’re moving to a group of people that will be harder to reach.”At least three out of four people who sign up for the exchanges for the first time this year will have been previously uninsured, according to the administration’s projection.HHS expects 83 percent of the 7.1 million people covered as of last month to re-enroll this year, Burwell said.The U.S. website where people can sign up for coverage, healthcare.gov, opened yesterday in a “window shopping” mode that lets people see what plans they can buy for next year.The preview feature, added to the revamped website, is intended to ease pressure on the system by letting curious consumers look at prices for health plans a week before enrollment begins. Last year, consumers who tried to use the website were met with errors and delays that prevented millions from signing up for several months.Challenges are mounting for the second year of enrollment as Republicans gained control of Congress last week and the Supreme Court announced it will consider whether a key feature, subsidies to reduce the cost of insurance, should be available to all Americans. Consumers should be confident that the high court will rule in favor of the administration, Burwell said today, allowing the subsidies to continue.“The administration has been clear all along we believe that is the intention of the law,” Burwell said, responding to a question from former Ohio Governor Ted Strickland. “That is where we will stay and be.”","Compose the article as a bookmark, with a brief summary or quote that captures the story's essence.","The Department of Health and Human Services reported today that the number of people enrolled in new government-run health insurance markets created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is lower than previously expected.

Former presidents speak to remind the faithful of their history. Bill Clinton falls into both categories, but he had a far more difficult task in closing out the second night of the Democratic convention in Philadelphia on Tuesday night; he needed to find a way to knit the party back together again.That's a tall order, and not just because the evening started with a walkout involving hundreds of Bernie Sanders delegates, according to one estimate . A generation has passed since the former president ascended to lead the Democratic Party as the first baby boomer major-party nominee, and then defeated the last of the World War II presidents.Back then, Bill used his enormous natural political talent to fuse the New Left with working class Democrats, while ""triangulating"" on the Republican agenda to carve a centrist path in governance.Twenty-four years later, it's not Bill Clinton's Democratic Party. It might not be Hillary Clinton's Democratic Party. If it hadn't been for the establishment-protecting superdelegates and the Democratic National Convention's efforts to tip the primary scales in her favor, it would likely have been Bernie Sanders' Democratic Party -- and on Tuesday in Philadelphia, with hundreds of empty seats staring back at the stage, it certainly looked as though it was.Twenty-four years later, Bill Clinton isn't the same, youthful physical force, either. At times he seemed frail and at one point a bit distracted. However, Clinton proved that his political instincts haven't dimmed much at all.

"Two climbers made it to the top of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park on Wednesday, the first ever to scale the 3,000-foot granite wall using only their hands and feet and safety rope.For 19 days, Kevin Jorgeson, 30, of Santa Rosa, Calif., and Tommy Caldwell, 36, of Colorado, attempted what many considered impossible on one of the world's most difficult climbs: Being the first to ""free climb"" the sheer face of El Capitan's Dawn Wall. They used safety ropes and harnesses to prevent deadly falls, but did not using ropes or climbing aids to reach the top. The two climbed the wall in 32 rope-length sections that climbers call pitches, and they reached the summit around 3:30 p.m. PT.Patagonia, the clothing and gear maker, sponsored the climb.Caldwell was the first to finish. He waited on a ledge for Jorgeson, who caught up minutes later. The two embraced before Jorgeson pumped his arms in the air and clapped his hands above his head. Then they sat down for a few moments, gathered their gear, changed clothes and hiked to the nearby summit.In the meadow below, a crowd broke into cheers. Caldwell's mother, Terry, said her son could have reached the top several days ago, but he waited for his friend to make sure they got there together.""That's a deep, abiding, lifelong friendship, built over suffering on the wall together over six years,"" she said.President Obama sent his congratulations from the White House Twitter account, saying the men ""remind us that anything is possible.""Each trained for more than five years, and they have battled bloodied fingers and unseasonably warm weather. The men often climbed at dusk or later, using headlamps to see, because the rock needs to be cold to keep fingers and hands from sweating and slipping.Jorgeson fell 11 times over seven days trying to get past one particularly tough section. He took to Facebook on Sunday to publicly celebrate his victory.""It took everything in my power to stay positive and resolved that I would succeed,"" he wrote.The climb began Dec. 27 and was expected to take two weeks. It is the realization of a dream that began seven years ago when Caldwell first began climbing the monster rock formation, he said.They've slept in portaledges — tents attached to the face of the wall.El Capitan, the largest granite monolith in the world, has about 100 routes to the top.

She was held in contempt by a federal judge Thursday for refusing to hand out marriage licenses in defiance of the U.S. Supreme Court. So early Friday, Yates and Smith walked up to Deputy Clerk Brian Mason.Mason was all business.

"He's combative. He rejects compromise as ""the mushy middle."" He's not inclined to wait his turn. And he doesn't seem to mind annoying his Republican elders with tactics that critics see as destructive and short-sighted.So perhaps it's no surprise that little more than two years after he was sworn in to the Senate, the 44-year-old Texan on Monday became the first contender to officially announce his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. He skipped the one-step-at-a-time tradition of announcing an ""exploratory"" committee to declare flatly that he was in the race.""It's going to take a new generation of courageous conservatives to help make America great again,"" Cruz said in a 30-second video he posted on Twitter early Monday morning, followed by a speech at Liberty University, ""and I'm ready to stand with you to lead the fight.""He won't be lonely for long. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is slated to announce his candidacy in two weeks, likely followed in short order by yet another Republican senator, Marco Rubio of Florida.

In the Senate, he has been more of an agitator than a legislator. Arizona Sen. John McCain, the GOP's 2008 nominee, once called him a ""wacko bird.""That said, Cruz is worth watching.For one thing, the skills he honed as a college debater at Princeton — he was named U.S. National Speaker of the Year in 1992 — should serve him well in the series of crowded primary debates.For another, while his Tea Party credentials might be a mixed blessing in a general election, in the primaries they align him with the most energized forces in the Republican grass roots today. That helped him upset the establishment's favorite, lieutenant governor David Dewhurst, for the Republican Senate nomination in 2012.What's more, the locale Cruz chose to make Monday's announcement reflects his efforts to broaden his electoral base by wooing Christian conservatives, another key group in the GOP coalition. He spoke at the Lynchburg, Va., school founded by evangelical leader Jerry Falwell that describes itself on its website as the largest Christian university in the world.His speech had the ring of the religious testimony of an evangelical church. He declared his opposition to abortion and his support of traditional marriage. He emotionally described how his father's embrace of Jesus saved his parents' marriage. His father, Rafael, a pastor at a suburban Dallas church, fled Castro's Cuba in 1957.Cruz's Cuban-American heritage would be a selling point for the Republican Party as it tries to reach out to Hispanic voters, although his hardline stance on immigration could be a complication with those voters. And speaking of biography, he has an education that might surprise those inclined to dismiss him: He was graduated from Princeton and then from Harvard Law School, magna cum laude, before clerking at the Supreme Court for Chief Justice William Rehnquist.At one point, he urged his audience to ""take out your cellphones"" and text the word ""Constitution"" or ""Liberty"" — ""we're flexible,"" he said — to a number linked to his campaign.","Compose the article as a recipe, metaphorically cooking up solutions or ideas mentioned.",It is a metaphorically cooked up solution to the problem of writing a concise and informative summary of the text in a way that is clear and easy to read.**Ingredients:*** Text to be summarized* Culinary metaphors* Clear and concise language* Organization into a logical structure* Use of vivid imagery**Instructions:**1. **Read the text
"The federal government must make regular interest payments on the money it has borrowed to finance past deficits – that is, on the national debt held by the public.The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the federal government’s net interest payments on that debt will total $229 billion in the 2015 fiscal year. Working Americans end up having to foot that very large bill to varying degrees based on each individual taxpayer’s adjusted gross income.Click here to see your share of the federal debt.And the CBO expects that this challenge will accelerate over the next decade. Current interest rates are low by historical standards and higher interest rates means higher interest payments. It’s projected that net interest costs will more than triple over the next decade, reaching $808 billion in 2025.These numbers pose a real threat. The CBO has issued warnings about the serious negative consequences that such high and rising debt and interest payments on the debt could have on both the economy and the federal budget.“The large amount of debt might restrict policymakers’ ability to use tax and spending policies to respond to unexpected future challenges, such as economic downturns or financial crises,” the CBO said in a recent report.In the same report, they also cautioned that continued growth in the debt could lead investors to doubt the government’s willingness or ability to pay its obligations, which would require the government to pay much higher interest rates on its borrowing going forward.","Rewrite the text as a series of tweets, capturing the essence of the story in short messages.","**Tweet 1:**The federal government must make regular interest payments on its national debt, estimated to total $229 billion in 2015. #NationalDebt**Tweet 2:**Working Americans end up footing the large bill for federal debt interest payments based on their adjusted gross income. #TaxImpact**Tweet 3:**Current low interest rates are projected to increase over the next decade, leading to higher interest payments and a"

"The Republican presidential candidates are seizing on the “top secret” Hillary Clinton emails in the final weekend before the Iowa Caucus, trying to slow their top Democratic rival by arguing her mishandling of the messages makes her unfit to be president.“Hillary Clinton is a major national security risk. Not presidential material!” GOP frontrunner Donald Trump tweeted after the State Department said Friday that it will withhold 22 emails from Clinton's correspondence as secretary of state because they are classified “top secret.”Trump and the 10 other Republican candidates are barnstorming across Iowa this weekend ahead of the Iowa Caucus on Monday, the first-in-the-nation balloting in the 2016 presidential race.Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, revealed last spring that she used a private server and email accounts for official business when she was the country’s top diplomat.The State Department has in compliance with a federal court order released thousands of page of Clinton emails, with classified information redacted. However the agency said Friday that the 22 top-secret messages, in seven email chains, will not be released.The intelligence community has deemed some of Clinton’s emails “too damaging"" to national security to release under any circumstances, a U.S. government official close to the ongoing review told Fox News.“The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton,” Trump also tweeted. “At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?”Clinton has repeatedly said she never sent classified information through her private accounts. Her campaign on Friday questioned the secrecy of the messages and called for the State Department to release them.The FBI is investigating the matter, which has raised questions about how federal agencies have different rules for classifying information and whether some of the emails were marked classified after the fact.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s top primary challenger, has declined to talk about the emails.There is a “legal process in place, which should proceed and not be politicized,"" he said Friday.During the first Democratic debate last year, Sanders famously dismissed the issue by saying, ""the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails!""He trails Clinton by rough 5 percentage points in Iowa but leads her by roughly 15 points in New Hampshire, which votes Feb. 9, according to the RealClearPolitics poll averaging.Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, running third in most GOP polls behind Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, told an audience in Clinton, Iowa, that such sensitive emails being on Clinton’s server is “not acceptable.”Cruz suggests that Clinton’s use of the private server and emails now appears “far more serious” than previously thought and that the most recent revelations put her candidacy into more peril.Cruz, who has 15 events in Iowa before the caucus, is also raising questions about whether the Justice Department, run by the Obama administration, would indeed indict Clinton, if the investigation leads to that decision.“There is an acceptance that the enforcement of criminal justice is decided not by the laws of this country, but by some political hack in the West Wing of the White House.That is not how our Constitution is meant to operate,” Cruz said on the Hugh Hewitt radio show.“If she is indicted, it is difficult to see how she could successfully run for president. I would put nothing past the gall and audacity of the Clintons to try. But even the Democratic Party, I would find it hard to believe that they would be eager to nominate someone who is under indictment and could well face felony incarceration.”Fox News' Catherine Herridge and Pamela K.

"Boston magazine has a long take on William Weld, former Massachusetts governor, currently Libertarian vice presidential candidate.The main takeaway, after some of the usual slightly sneery scene-setting about weirdo libertarians (reported from July's FreedomFest in Las Vegas) and the lovely color detail of the patrician Weld being amazed he's staying in a New York hotel whose price is three digits beginning with ""one""?That while Weld totally thinks of himself as libertarian and has for a long time, he's also a guy who just likes to do strange and challenging things as a lark, like writing novels, and hates being bored and likes being in the political mix.An unnamed former adviser says ""There's nothing more he would like than to be flying around the country on somebody else's dime, flying first class, and talking to political reporters all day."" Another unnamed former staffer says of Weld ""He is old money, white, and fucking brilliant...Everybody tries to distance himself from those traits when running for office, and he always embraced them and made them his own.""Reason has written quite a bit on some conflicts between Weld and libertarianism as most define it, despite Weld's long-time affection for that self-identification, and this profile is decent on explaining that aspect of the Weld/Libertarian story.The profile by Simon van Zuylen-Wood sums up that conflict:Weld's strategy isn't to try to defend libertarian ideas. Instead he articulates the ones he thinks disaffected centrists want to hear.

When asked about gun control, Weld suggests the formation—cue a million Libertarians choking on their dinner—of a massive new FBI task force.... .... I ask him, at random, about climate change.

"Donald Trump easily won the Washington state primary on Tuesday, but his victory was overshadowed by violence outside a rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where protesters smashed windows and threw rocks at police.With 73% of votes counted in Washington, Trump had won 76.2% of primary voters. John Kasich and Ted Cruz, both of whom have dropped out of the race, had won 9.9.% and 10.1% respectively.Trump’s victory leaves him only needing a few dozen more delegates to reach the magic number of 1,237 required to cement the Republican nomination.Outside Trump’s rally in Albuquerque, protests against the presumptive nominee turned nasty on Tuesday night, with protesters overturning crowd control barriers and throwing rocks at police.There were early posts on social media reporting gunshots and tear gas, but the Albuquerque police department said those were inaccurate. Nonetheless, police horses were deployed to control the large crowd of protesters, and some reports showed pepper spray being used. The door to the convention center where Trump was speaking was also smashed.More than an hour after Trump had finished speaking and left for California, where he will campaign for the next few days in the run-up to the state’s 7 June primary, hundreds of protesters still thronged the streets, waving Mexican flags, lighting fires and chanting.Trump is the only remaining candidate campaigning for the Republican nomination, but Kasich and Cruz were also on the ballot in Washington, having suspended their campaigns after the ballots were printed.Dr Ben Carson was also on the ballot because he reportedly never officially submitted a withdrawal of his candidacy to the state.The state delegation, which was selected on Saturday at the state convention in preparation for the primary, is composed almost entirely of supporters of Cruz, whose supporters overwhelmed the state convention in Pasco.Despite this, the delegates are bound by state party rules to vote for Trump on the first ballot at the national convention, US senate candidate and former chairman of the Washington state Republican party Chris Vance, who was at the convention, told the Guardian.However, with seven upcoming primaries, including New Jersey and California, Trump is expected to easily overtake the delegate mark needed to win the nomination on the first ballot at the convention in Cleveland in July, avoiding a contested convention.In a strange quirk of party politics, the Democrats also held a presidential primary in Washington on Tuesday, but it didn’t matter in the slightest because the Democratic delegation from Washington was already settled by a caucus in March, at which Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton 73% to 27%.Interestingly, in the Democratic primary – which was admittedly meaningless as it has no bearing on the number of delegates as opposed to the caucuses – Clinton won comfortably, 53.63% to 46.37%, implying that perhaps Democratic voters want the primary season to be, finally, over with.","Incorporate historical context into the article, comparing and contrasting the events or information with similar historical events or trends.","The event unfolded amidst a historical context of similar occurrences and trends.In the 1960s, the Republican Party faced a similar situation when its presumptive nominee, Barry Goldwater, was met with violence in Chicago.

"The Islamic faith isn’t “consistent” with the U.S. Constitution, and a Muslim shouldn’t be president, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said.“I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation,” Carson said on NBC’s 'Meet the Press' on Sunday.  Late Sunday, he doubled down on those comments in an interview with The Hill.  “I do not believe Sharia is consistent with the Constitution of this country,” Carson told The Hill. “Muslims feel that their religion is very much a part of your public life and what you do as a public official, and that’s inconsistent with our principles and our Constitution.”Editor's Note: Is Ben Carson Your Candidate for 2016? Vote Here.Earlier, Carson told NBC's Chuck Todd that the religious beliefs of a president would matter if his or her faith was inconsistent with U.S. values. His view contrasted with that of Donald Trump, the billionaire front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, who said on the program that a Muslim as president is something that could happen in the future.Trump said he knows many Muslims who are “fabulous,” but there’s “a very severe problem” with some Muslims around the world -- comments he repeated on other Sunday broadcasts.Special: Dr. Ben Carson's Vision for America, See It“This is the first I’ve ever gotten into hot water for not saying anything,” Trump said.

Scott Walker said Tuesday that he was ""very interested"" in a possible run for president on 2016, hours after he announced the launch of a new political committee.In an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Walker said he was considering a run for the same reason he initially ran for governor of Wisconsin in 2010.""[My wife and I] were afraid that our sons were growing up in a state that wasn't as great as the one we grew up in,"" Walker, 47, said."" I have the same worries about this country for my sons today that I had for my state many years ago.""Walker, who gave a well-received speech to a forum of conservative voters in Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday, set up the committee “Our American Revival” on Jan. 16. A new website for the so-called 527 organization, which will help him get his message out as he works toward building his political clout, went live Tuesday morning.""Our American Revival encompasses the shared values that make our country great,"" Walker said in a written statement. He called for ""limiting the powers of the federal government to those defined in the Constitution while creating a leaner, more efficient, more effective and more accountable government to the American people.""Walker echoed that refrain on ""Hannity"" and played up his status as a Washington outsider.""I think we need new bold leadership from outside of Washington that's proven to take on the challenges that we face in this country right now,"" Walker said. ""The ideas that are going to transform America aren't coming from people in Washington. They're coming from our state leaders ...

"The family of Michael Brown will file a civil lawsuit against the city of Ferguson, Missouri, and former Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, an attorney for the family announced Thursday.The news comes just one day after the U.S. Department of Justice officially announced its decision not to file federal charges against Wilson for fatally shooting Brown last July.In a press conference, family attorney Anthony Gray expressed the family’s disappointment in the Justice Department’s decision and announced the next legal actions they plan to take.“We are officially formulating a civil case that we anticipate will be filed very shortly on behalf of the family,” Gray said. “We plan to demonstrate in a court of law that Wilson’s choice to use deadly force was unreasonable and unnecessary.”Brown's parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr., attended the conference but did not make any comments. However, their frustration with the department's decision is widely shared by many local officials, residents and protesters -- some of whom took to the streets Wednesday evening to demonstrate their outrage.The criticism was further fueled by a scathing report released by the Justice Department, also on Wednesday. The report revealed that the city of Ferguson had engaged in unconstitutional patrolling practices that routinely discriminated against African-Americans. It also disclosed emails proving racial bias on behalf of Ferguson police officials.""[It] really just confirms what many of us already knew and what has been experienced by many African-Americans here in the St. Louis region for quite some time,"" St. Louis Alderman Antonio French told HuffPost Live on Wednesday, referring to the report.""Some of the specific details were shocking, [but] there's a culture that's been allowed to fester in Ferguson and one that's really been experienced by African-Americans for years and boiled over last year,"" French continued.Attorneys for the Brown family say they hope some level of accountability can be reached through the civil case. Meanwhile, French has taken the lead in calling for the resignation of the chief of the Ferguson Police Department.“I think some of the specific details outlined in this Department of Justice report really make it impossible for him to stay there,” he said. “When you have the culture that exists with these racist emails ... the stats alone suggest he needs to go.""",Imagine it as a pitch to a venture capitalist for a startup related to the story.,"The news comes on the heels of the U.S. Department of Justice's decision not to file federal charges against Wilson for the fatal shooting.The family attorney, Anthony Gray, expressed their disappointment in the Justice Department's decision and announced the next legal actions"
"Say what you will about Donald Trump, but the man is winner. Trump didn’t just wallop his opponents Tuesday — he crushed them. Up 41 percent in Delaware, 40 percent in Rhode Island, 37 percent in Pennsylvania, 33 percent in Maryland, 30 percent in Connecticut, he’s estimated to have won 110 delegates, versus five for Kasich and three for Cruz.If the race for the GOP nomination were a Little League game, the mercy rule would be imposed.Here’s where we stand today. Ted Cruz is mathematically eliminated from winning the Republican nomination before the convention in Cleveland. John Kasich has now won a single state — Ohio — where he is governor. If ever there were a series of states that would at least theoretically be fertile territory for him, it would be the Northeast, home of the last vestiges of Republican moderates. Yet, he didn’t crack 30 percent anywhere. Republicans can talk all they want about Never Trump and trying to stop him at the RNC in Cleveland. They can talk about changing the rules and holding out hope that a white knight candidate will emerge. It isn’t going to happen. Either Trump is the nominee or he’ll burn the whole thing to the ground. If you’re a gambler, go all in on the former.It is worth stepping back, however, and noting that Trump’s hammerlock over the party — and his ascendancy within the GOP — is astounding. He’s a political amateur who never held elected office; he’s a xenophobe, a bully, and a misogynist and he has run directly against the leadership of the party he hopes to lead. Yet, today he stands on the cusp of winning the nomination of the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Nixon, and Reagan. I know we’ve all become inured to Trump’s insults, his know-nothingness, and his crudeness, but it can’t be said enough — truly we are living in a political moment unlike anything that any of us has seen before.Here’s what might be even more amazing: Trump’s position as the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party is not the most remarkable political event this year. Rather, it’s that the Democratic Party is poised to nominate the first woman to be a major party candidate for president. Somehow this constantly seems to be forgotten; and whether you like Hillary Clinton or despise her, that America is poised to nominate a woman for president is a big deal.Tuesday night, Clinton racked up four more primary wins, including the delegate-rich states of Maryland and Pennsylvania. Only in Rhode Island did Bernie Sanders thwart her. Early on in the evening, before all the races had been called, he gave a “victory” speech in West Virginia that not only left unmentioned the evening’s results, but plowed forward with confidence about the road ahead. It’s a fitting metaphor for the Sanders campaign, which increasingly seems to operate in a realm completely divorced from reality. Sanders cannot and will not win the Democratic nomination. Period.Indeed, in her victory speech, Clinton — as she has increasingly done — simply ignored Sanders. Instead she aimed her daggers at her real target, Donald Trump. The Democratic race will continue, but for all intents and purposes, it is over. Clinton can now begin her pivot to the general election, and Sanders can play out the string.What we now with some certainty is that we’re only a few months away from an historic, unprecedented presidential campaign — and no matter which candidate wins on Election Day, history will be made.","Transform the article into a series of blog posts, diving deeper into different aspects of the story.","****Trump's Hammerlock and the Republican Nomination**Donald Trump's victory in Tuesday's primary elections has cemented his position as the presumptive Republican nominee.

"(CNN) Donald Trump is ratcheting up his rhetoric about American Muslims, saying there's precedent for monitoring some mosques amid the recent terror wave.At a Birmingham, Alabama, rally on Saturday -- which included a physical altercation between a black protester and several white Trump backers -- the 2016 Republican front-runner suggested law enforcement keep an eye on certain Islamic houses of worship which, in his view, could pose terrorist threats.""I want surveillance of certain mosques if that's OK,"" Trump told the often-raucous and approving crowd. ""We've had it before.""The remarks echo a call Trump made earlier in the week, when he said on MSNBC he'd ""strongly consider"" shutting down mosques in the U.S.The billionaire businessman also linked current terrorist concerns, after the Paris carnage and other attacks, with 9/11.""I watched the World Trade Center go down,"" Trump asserted, adding he watched in New Jersey, ""as thousands of people were cheering as the building was coming down.""Trump then denounced calls to resettle Syrian refuges on U.S. soil, which his Republican rivals for the nomination also oppose.""I want surveillance. I will absolutely take (a) database on the people coming in from Syria. ""If we can't stop it -- but we are going to if I win -- they're going back.""Several attendees at the rally punched and kicked a protester who tried to disrupt Trump's speech.At least a half-dozen attendees shoved and tackled the protester, a black man, to the ground as he refused to leave the event. At least one man punched the protester and a woman kicked him while he was on the ground.All of the attendees who were involved in the physical altercation with the protester were white.The protester appeared to be shouting ""black lives matter"" and later removed his sweatshirt to reveal a shirt with those words.At least one attendee shouted ""all lives matter"" as the protester was eventually led out by police officers on the scene.Birmingham Police Lt. Sean Edwards told CNN that three people were asked to leave the event following the scuffle. No arrests were made, and the protester did not require medical attention.Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks told CNN that ""the campaign does not condone this behavior.""Trump has fended off criticism recently that he was accused of backing a U.S. database on all Muslims in the country. Trump has denied making that remark but hasn't dismissed the idea out-of-hand.The database controversy began Thursday when Trump told Yahoo News that he would create new anti-terrorism measures if he's elected.""We're going to have to do things that we never did before. And some people are going to be upset about it, but I think that now everybody is feeling that security is going to rule,"" he told Yahoo News. ""And certain things will be done that we never thought would happen in this country in terms of information and learning about the enemy. And so we're going to have to do certain things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago.""The Yahoo reporter asked about the possibility of a database for Muslims or ""a form of special identification that noted their religion."" Trump did not say no to either idea. Then, after an Iowa campaign event later that day, an NBC reporter asked Trump if he favored a database to track Muslims in the country. Trump responded in a way some took as backing that idea.At Saturday's rally in Alabama, Trump said he decided not to answer once he heard the reporter identified as being with NBC News.","Rewrite the text as a codex or ancient scroll, giving it a historical or mystical aura.","O ancient scroll of wisdom and foreboding, I present unto thee a tale of a time not so distant, a time when the winds carried whispers of terror and the seeds of hate bloomed like poisonous flowers.In the land of Birmingham, where shadows danced with the sun, a demagogue named Trump uttered words that echoed through the halls of history.

"North Charleston Police Officer Michael T. Slager, 33, can be seen shooting 50-year-old Walter Scott after a confrontation on Saturday, according to The Post and Courier. Slager chases Scott and shoots at him eight times in the video recorded by a passerby and obtained by The New York Times.The confrontation started when Slager had reportedly pulled over Scott because of a broken taillight. It escalated into a foot chase as Scott allegedly fled because there were family court-issued warrants for his arrest. Slager pursued Scott into a grassy lot and claimed that he fired his Taser to subdue him.Earlier this week, an attorney for Slager said the cop felt threatened after Scott tried to overpower him and take his Taser. Today that attorney told The Post and Courier that he's ""no longer involved"" in the case.But first images in the video are of Slager shooting at Scott as he runs away from him. It also appears that Slager drops the Taser near Scott after he was gunned down, according to The New York Times.Police reports also say that responding officers performed CPR and delivered medical aid to Scott, but the video shows Scott face down in handcuffs for several minutes after the shooting. Another officer shows up and appears to give Scott aid, but never performs CPR.Police Chief Eddie Driggers said Tuesday that Slager had been arrested. The U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement that FBI investigators would work with the State Law Enforcement Division, which typically investigates officer-involved shootings in South Carolina, and the state’s attorney general to investigate any civil rights violations in Scott’s death. Mayor Keith Summey added during a news conference that as a result of the video and Slager’s “bad decision,” the officer would be charged with murder.Scott had been arrested about 10 times in the past, mostly for failing to pay child support or show up for hearings, according to the paper.""He has four children, he doesn’t have some type of big violent past or arrest record. He had a job, he was engaged,"" a lawyer for Scott's family told the Times. ""He had back child support and didn’t want to go to jail for back child support.""In a statement released Tuesday night, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley (R) said, ""What happened in this case is not acceptable in South Carolina."" Senator Tim Scott (R) said ""The senseless shooting and taking of Walter Scott's life was absolutely unnecessary and avoidable,"" adding that he would be watching the case closely.The shooting in North Charleston comes on the heels of several high-profile cases of police officers using deadly force against unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, Cleveland and New York. This is one of the few times the offending officer has been charged with murder.""What if there was no video? What if there was no witness? Where would we be without that video,"" Justin Bamberg said at a presser with the family on Tuesday night. Bamburg is one of the Scotts' family attorneys and also represents South Carolina's House District 90.Family attorney L. Chris Stewart called the witness who recorded the video a ""hero,"" saying that video evidence disproved initial reports that Scott reached for the Slager's Taser. Stewart added that the witness is working with investigators and may eventually come forward.""If there was no video, I do not believe that officer would be in jail,"" Bamberg said. ""From what the video shows, I think that provides the necessary ammunition to hold this officer accountable.""""I don't think anybody can see that and not see that what that officer did was murder Mr. Scott in cold blood,"" Bamberg said. ""What would have happened if this witness did not have the courage to stand up and do the right thing and decide that what he witnessed was wrong?

"Jindal, the Republican governor of Louisiana, referred to Obama's comments as a ""history lesson"" that ignores ""the issue right in front of his nose.""""We will be happy to keep an eye out for runaway Christians, but it would be nice if he would face the reality of the situation today,"" Jindal said in a statement out Friday. ""The Medieval Christian threat is under control, Mr. President. Please deal with the Radical Islamic threat today.""Santorum, who ran for president in 2012 as well, rebuked Obama for ignoring the threat of ISIS and criticizing people of faith.""Today's remarks by the President were inappropriate and his choice of venue was insulting to every person of faith at a time when Christians are being crucified, beheaded, and persecuted across the Middle East,"" the former Pennsylvania senator said in a statement.The comments, which were intended to illustrate the potential for religion to be used for both good and bad aims, drew fierce criticism from conservatives on Thursday. And with Santorum's decision to weigh in, could rapidly become fodder for attacks from potential 2016 contenders looking to burnish their credentials with the religious right. Santorum went on to slam Obama for misunderstanding the threat posed by the rise of Islamic extremism, and accused him of tying modern Christians to ""the scourge in the Middle East."" ""While Christians of today are taught to live their lives as the reflection of Christ's love, the radicals of ISIS use their holy texts as a rationale for violence,"" he said. ""To insinuate modern Christians — the same Christian faith that led the abolitionist movement, the Civil Rights Movement, and global charitable efforts fighting disease and poverty — cannot stand up against the scourge we see in the Middle East is wrong."" Santorum also suggested that some Muslims have only been opposed to ISIS' burning a Jordanian pilot alive because they are opposed to the ""tactic,"" not the actual murder itself. ""Some Muslims...[have] sat quietly by as the Islamic State uses brutal violence that is not antithetical to Islam and only objects on tactics,"" he said. During the National Prayer Breakfast, Obama didn't downplay the threat posed by ISIS, but instead made the case that ""humanity has been grappling with"" the tension between the good and bad deeds done in the name of religion for ages. ""And lest we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place, remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ,"" he said. ""In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ. Michelle and I returned from India — an incredible, beautiful country, full of magnificent diversity — but a place where, in past years, religious faiths of all types have, on occasion, been targeted by other peoples of faith, simply due to their heritage and their beliefs — acts of intolerance that would have shocked Gandhiji, the person who helped to liberate that nation."" But conservatives decried his comments as both further evidence of his poor grasp of the threats facing the nation, and insulting to Christians. Talk-radio host Rush Limbaugh said he insulted ""the whole gamut of Christians,"" and Jim Gilmore, the former GOP governor of Virginia, called the comments ""the most offensive I've ever heard a president make in my lifetime,"" according to the New York Times And Catholic League President Bill Donohue — a frequent critic of Obama — called the comments ""insulting"" and ""pernicious"" in a statement, and said Obama was trying to ""deflect guilt from Muslim madmen.""","Reimagine the article as a speculative fiction story, incorporating futuristic elements or technology.","In a futuristic world where technology intertwined with society, the Republican governor of Louisiana, Jindal, made a controversial statement that ignited a firestorm of criticism.

"WASHINGTON -- Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is confident there will be no government shutdown this fall because Republicans are in charge on Capitol Hill, he said Friday.""I’m not worried about that because we control both sides of the rotunda, the House and the Senate,"" Ryan, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a briefing with reporters.Ryan is optimistic despite the fact that the House has only passed about half of the 12 appropriations measures that are required to keep the government running through September, the Senate hasn't passed any yet, and Congress is on vacation for most of August.Democrats in the upper chamber are blocking the funding measures there because they are angry that the GOP decided to boost military spending above levels set by the 2011 Budget Control Act and its sequestration rules, while leaving in place steep cuts to domestic programs that are Democratic priorities.President Barack Obama has threatened to veto appropriations bills that don't deal with both military and domestic programs, and his allies in the Senate are demanding that Republicans open up a process now to resolve the impasse. Ryan managed to cut a deal with Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash) two years ago, when both were chairs of their respective budget committees, that eased sequestration cuts evenly.Neither Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) nor House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) have suggested any willingness to do something similar this time around, and Senate Democrats are vowing to stand firm until Republicans start negotiating.Ryan said that he thought a new version of a Ryan-Murray deal could be struck under the leadership of the current budget chairmen, Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) and Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.).But he stuck by his party's line that Congress should keep passing its regular funding bills before starting to negotiate, pointing to the Department of Defense bill that is currently being blocked.""If they filibuster DOD approps over there in the Senate, I think it's a shame if they do that, but we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it,"" he said.Asked if he could support raising the spending caps set in 2011's deal -- as he and Murray did in 2013 -- he didn't say no, but insisted such a move would have to be paid for in some way.""The precedent that Patty and I set was mandatory savings in excess of discretionary add-backs to result in deficit reduction -- net deficit reduction,"" he said.""These things have to be paid for,"" Ryan added, ""What's the point in having spending caps if they don't enforce fiscal discipline?""Asked why Republican control made him optimistic about passing appropriations bills, especially considering the poor functioning of the Senate, Ryan merely replied: ""It's functioning a whole lot better than it did a year ago,"" when Democrats were in charge.When Congress did shut down the government for two weeks in 2013, Republicans only controlled the House, but they got the blame because they had insisted on trying to use government funding to gut the Affordable Care Act.","Translate the text into a visual infographic, summarizing key facts and figures in a graphical format.","****Infographic Summary of Key Facts and Figures****Key Points:*** Rep.

"“Our fight for LGBT equality is not nearly over,” Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) stated emphatically in an interview with me last week on SiriusXM Progress. “And I’m hopeful, very hopeful, that the Supreme Court will say it’s unconstitutional to ban gay marriage. But that’s really just the beginning of fighting for our rights. We have to actually make sure all LGBT couples can have full parenting rights, have full social security and other federal benefit rights. We want to make sure companies can’t discriminate against members of the community because of who they love and who they are. And it’s really important [to take on] discrimination wherever it exists.”Toward that end, Gillibrand last week reintroduced the Every Child Deserve a Family Act, which she originally introduced in 2013 and which would bar adoption and foster care agencies that receive federal dollars from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. Though Gillibrand says she's seeking bipartisan support in the Senate and will continue speaking with Republicans, so far co-sponsors include a handful of fellow Democrats, such as openly lesbian Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is running for the Democratic nomination for the presidency.“Only seven states ban discrimination based on sexual orientation in adoption, and only five explicitly ban discrimination in foster care,” Gillibrand said in the interview. “So we have a long way to go. We only have a few states protecting LGBT parents. The reality is, there are two million LGBT individuals and families that are willing and able to take on these parenting obligations, to adopt these children or foster these children who desperately need it. Unfortunately, there are 400,000 children in the U.S. foster care system today and more than 20,000 of them are going to age-out before finding a permanent home. So we should be caring for these kids. We should give them the loving families they deserve.”The bill, if it becomes law, would only affect those agencies that take federal money, and they are free to opt-out from receiving funds.""If you’re getting the benefit of federal funds, you can’t discriminate,” Gillibrand said. “It’s unconstitutional, and you should not be able to use our taxpayer dollars to discriminate against individuals based on their sexual orientation and who they love. So I think it’s important we fight against it, particularly when our taxpayer dollars are being used.”“This legislation would prohibit adoption agencies and foster care agencies, including religious adoption agencies and foster care agencies, from providing services in many cases,” Lori Windham, Senior Counsel with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty told the Catholic news agency, EWTN News. Peter Sprigg, senior fellow for policy studies at the Family Research Council, is quoted in the same article saying there are “unique problems” with allowing gays and lesbians to adopt children. Claiming there is “overwhelming” evidence while not citing any studies, Sprigg said, “I think it’s legitimate to disfavor them or to exclude them altogether.”","Reframe the article as a manifesto, outlining a revolutionary vision or call to action based on the content.","**A Manifesto for Equality and Justice**In the face of ongoing discrimination and marginalization, we must stand united in our pursuit of a world where all individuals are treated with respect and afforded equal opportunities.

"U.S. counterterrorism officials are reviewing databases of known terror suspects and other materials after the deadly Paris shooting Wednesday morning, as the Obama administration opened the door to increasing security in the U.S. in response.The terror attack on a satirical French publication known for lampooning Islam left at least 12 dead, and the attackers remain at large. U.S. officials already are in touch with their French counterparts.The attackers reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar,"" Arabic for ""God is great, before escaping.Two French officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, named the suspects to the Associated Press as Frenchmen Said Kouachi and Cherif Kouachi, in their early 30s, as well as 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad, whose nationality wasn't immediately clear.One of the officials said they were linked to a Yemeni terrorist network.All three remain at large.Cherif Kouachi was convicted in 2008 of terrorism charges for helping funnel fighters to Iraq's insurgency and sentenced to 18 months in prison.Fox News is told investigators had been reviewing terror databases, including for individuals who have traveled to Syria. They also looked to closed-circuit television and evidence from the crime scene.In addition to identifying the suspects, the focus will be on determining whether this is isolated or part of a series of attacks.It is thought to be an attack carried out by a small cell, which distinguishes this from recent lone-wolf attacks, including one in Ottawa, Canada, and another more recent attack in Sydney, Australia. Officials are looking at the level of premeditation, given eyewitness accounts that the gunmen asked for individuals by name as they stormed the office.In addition, Fox News is told the assailants showed skill and familiarity with their weapons, and their escape also showed premeditation.A Department of Homeland Security official told Fox News that the department is ""closely monitoring"" the situation.""DHS will not hesitate to adjust our security posture, as appropriate, to protect the American people,"" the official said, urging the public to report suspicious activity to law enforcement.However, the office of the U.S. Embassy in France tweeted that there are ""no plans"" to close the embassy in Paris or other diplomatic facilities in France despite ""misleading"" press reports.U.S. investigators are expected to get more formally involved, but only after a request from the French government.Based on conversations with government officials and analysts, they are looking at three categories of suspects: self-radicalized individuals; members of Al Qaeda and its affiliates, specifically Al Qaeda's offshoot in North Africa known as AQIM; and those who have traveled to Syria and gotten training from Al Qaeda or the Islamic State.The latest edition of Inspire magazine, from the Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen, calls for attacks on France, as well as America and other allies.Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., told Fox News he has confidence in French authorities who are pursuing suspects as well. ""I would think that one way or the other, they will find them,"" he said.King also said the attack should be a ""wake-up call"" for Congress not to cut funding for DHS, despite an ongoing fight over funding the administration's immigration initiatives.Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C.

"While Donald Trump doubled down this week on his vow to make Mexico pay for his proposed southern border wall, his campaign is reported to be weighing options that don’t necessarily involve the seemingly far-fetched scenario of the Mexican government handing America a great, big check.LifeZette first reported that the Republican presidential nominee and his top advisers are looking at using assets seized from drug cartels and other traffickers. This reportedly could involve establishing a “joint border security fund” -- holding seized assets from crackdowns on both sides of the border – for border construction and maintenance.Trump, asked Thursday by Fox News about the report, did not deny the option is on the table.“There are many ways that they can pay for the wall,” Trump said, calling it a “negotiation.”But he again insisted, “The United States will not be paying for the wall. Mexico will be paying for the wall.”Breitbart News, whose chairman Stephen Bannon left to be Trump’s campaign CEO, also reported that cartel resources would be seized to fund the wall if Trump wins.Trump supporter, and former presidential primary rival, Ben Carson floated another option Thursday night.Speaking with Fox News, Carson said money saved from enforcing the border could be used – though he did not elaborate on what level of savings the federal government could expect, particularly when Trump is proposing spending more money on border security resources.“Recognize that a lot of money is going to be saved by enforcing our borders, by not, you know, giving various types of benefits to people who are here illegally,” Carson said. “That money is money that we otherwise would not have had and that can be applied to the wall and various other things. That’s I believe the spirit in which that comment is made. I don't think Mexico is going to write a check out and say here, pay for the wall.”Trump has not addressed such details on the stump.He declared in his immigration policy speech Wednesday night that, “Mexico will pay for the wall … they don’t know it yet, but they’re going to pay.”That came after Trump met with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City, and both men left the meeting battling over the payment issue. Trump said they didn’t discuss “payment,” while Pena Nieto said he made clear Mexico will not put up the money.According to The Wall Street Journal, Trump added the line about payment into his Phoenix speech, in response to Pena Nieto’s claims.If a Trump administration did pursue using cartel assets to fund a wall, it would take billions. Trump has estimated the wall could be built for as little as $8 billion, though other analyses have put the cost much higher.Estimates of Mexican cartel revenue vary drastically. The U.S. government estimated a decade ago that Mexican traffickers make nearly $14 billion on drug sales to the U.S.","Reframe the text as an escape room scenario, with puzzles and challenges based on the story.","You are a detective in a mysterious escape room called ""The Wall of Secrets.""

"Why Negotiators At Paris Climate Talks Are Tossing The Kyoto ModelNegotiators and heads of state from nearly 200 countries are meeting for the next two weeks near Paris to craft a new treaty to slow global warming.It's the 21st ""Conference of the Parties"" held by the United Nations to tackle climate change. One treaty emerged, in 1997, after the conference in Kyoto, Japan. That's no longer in effect, and, in fact, the Kyoto Protocol, as it's known, didn't slow down the gradual warming of the planet.Now governments are ever more desperate to do something to slow warming — so much so that they've thrown out the model set in Kyoto and opted for a new approach for Paris.Valli Moosa, a former climate negotiator from South Africa, says the main reason Kyoto failed to slow warming lies largely with who wasn't included in the treaty. ""You actually cannot have a meaningful agreement without China and the United States being part of it,"" he says.The U.S. Senate refused to ratify the Kyoto treaty, so the world's biggest greenhouse-gas emitter didn't have skin in the game. And developing countries, including China and India, were not required to reduce emissions. Now those countries are becoming the biggest sources of greenhouse gases as their economies thrive. China, in fact, is now the world's biggest emitter, and India isn't far behind. Moreover, the Kyoto treaty had U.N. bureaucrats and negotiators setting goals for the participating countries to lower their greenhouse gases. Many countries didn't make their targets; others dropped out. Economies were at stake, and few countries were comfortable marching to a U.N. beat.So what negotiators are bringing to the table at the Paris talks is an arrangement whereby each country is offering to reduce its own emissions by whatever amount it can manage. And everybody participates, not just developed countries.Most nations arrive with a reduction target already in hand. What will be difficult is deciding who will pay how much to developing countries to build economies that won't keep producing high emissions.French negotiator Laurence Tubiana points out that the key to success is convincing governments that those economies can be ""low-carbon,"" and that this won't be a bar to developing wealth. ""How much I'm sacrificing for the sake of emissions reductions, that's no more,"" she says of the message that negotiators are pushing. ""And now ... the Chinese, even the Indians are really coming in. It's about low-carbon economy.""Previous attempts to replace the Kyoto treaty have failed. This new approach is voluntary, and most of the world has agreed theoretically to participate, which negotiators hope will sweeten things enough to get a deal. Still to be determined, however, is who will pay for this massive revolution in the world's energy economy, and what strings will be attached to their largesse.","Transform the article into a board of directors' report, analyzing the story's events in a corporate context.","The conference represents the 21st ""Conference of the Parties"" held by the United Nations to address this pressing issue.

"Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush smoked marijuana while in high school, a personal use of the drug that stands in contrast to his later political stance on the plant.“I drank alcohol and I smoked marijuana when I was at Andover,” Bush, the current Republican frontrunner seeking his party's 2016 presidential nomination, told the Boston Globe as part of a detailed new profile that describes his time at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. Both George H.W. Bush, Jeb's father, and George W. Bush, his brother, also attended the prestigious private school.“It was pretty common,"" Bush said of his substance use during that time. A former classmate of Bush's, Peter Tibbetts, recalled to the newspaper that the first time he ever smoked marijuana was with Bush, in some woods near their dorm.“The first time I really got stoned was in Jeb’s room,” Tibbetts told the Globe. “He had a portable stereo with removable speakers. He put on Steppenwolf for me.” Tibbetts was eventually forced to leave the boarding school after being accused of using drugs.As a politician, Bush has not embraced marijuana. He spent much of his time as Florida governor championing jail instead of treatment for nonviolent drug offenders, and pushed for mandatory prison sentences for drug offenders -- with the exception of his daughter, Noelle, who has struggled with crack cocaine use.More recently, while acknowledging that states should ""have a right"" to decide on the legalization of marijuana, Bush publicly opposed an amendment to legalize medical marijuana in Florida.""Florida leaders and citizens have worked for years to make the Sunshine State a world-class location to start or run a business, a family-friendly destination for tourism and a desirable place to raise a family or retire,” Bush said before the November midterm election. ""Allowing large-scale marijuana operations to take root across Florida, under the guise of using it for medicinal purposes, runs counter to all of these efforts.""“You would think he’d have a little more understanding then,” Paul, who may be a rival to Bush in the Republican primary, told The Hill Friday. “He was even opposed to medical marijuana.

"Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush smoked marijuana while in high school, a personal use of the drug that stands in contrast to his later political stance on the plant.“I drank alcohol and I smoked marijuana when I was at Andover,” Bush, the current Republican frontrunner seeking his party's 2016 presidential nomination, told the Boston Globe as part of a detailed new profile that describes his time at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. Both George H.W. Bush, Jeb's father, and George W. Bush, his brother, also attended the prestigious private school.“It was pretty common,"" Bush said of his substance use during that time. A former classmate of Bush's, Peter Tibbetts, recalled to the newspaper that the first time he ever smoked marijuana was with Bush, in some woods near their dorm.“The first time I really got stoned was in Jeb’s room,” Tibbetts told the Globe. “He had a portable stereo with removable speakers. He put on Steppenwolf for me.” Tibbetts was eventually forced to leave the boarding school after being accused of using drugs.As a politician, Bush has not embraced marijuana. He spent much of his time as Florida governor championing jail instead of treatment for nonviolent drug offenders, and pushed for mandatory prison sentences for drug offenders -- with the exception of his daughter, Noelle, who has struggled with crack cocaine use.More recently, while acknowledging that states should ""have a right"" to decide on the legalization of marijuana, Bush publicly opposed an amendment to legalize medical marijuana in Florida.""Florida leaders and citizens have worked for years to make the Sunshine State a world-class location to start or run a business, a family-friendly destination for tourism and a desirable place to raise a family or retire,” Bush said before the November midterm election. ""Allowing large-scale marijuana operations to take root across Florida, under the guise of using it for medicinal purposes, runs counter to all of these efforts.""“You would think he’d have a little more understanding then,” Paul, who may be a rival to Bush in the Republican primary, told The Hill Friday. “He was even opposed to medical marijuana.

"CENTENNIAL, Colo. — Gone are the orange hair and the thousand-yard stare. In their place, trimmed hair, a shaggy beard and red-framed glasses.Sitting upright in court in a dark jacket, blue striped shirt and khaki slacks, James Holmes looking very much like the neuroscience graduate student he used to be, not a man on trial for his life.But Holmes, now 27, faces 12 murder charges in connection with the summer 2012 massacre at a suburban Denver movie theater's midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises. He could be executed if convicted. Holmes also faces dozens of other charges, including attempted murder. At least 70 were wounded in the massacre.Jury selection in the case began Tuesday afternoon, and Judge Carlos Samour said an initial pool of 9,000 jurors will be whittled down to 12, plus 12 alternates. The trial may last into October.Once opening statements get underway, cameras will be allowed in the courtroom. However, they are not allowed during jury selection.In a lengthy address to prosecutors and Holmes' defense team, Samour said he expects ""passionate and zealous"" courtroom arguments, but reminded both sides and prospective jurors that Holmes is innocent until proven guilty. The jury that will decide Holmes' guilt also will decide whether he should be executed.""What's most important to me is that justice is done,"" said Samour. ""That's what this whole process is about: Justice.""Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler wants Holmes put to death for the July 20, 2012, mass shooting in Aurora. He argues that life in prison is insufficient justice for the victims, survivors and their families.By pleading not guilty by reason of insanity, Holmes admitted he committed the shooting but claims he's legally not responsible for his actions. He's undergone at least two mental-health evaluations at the state mental hospital, but the results have remained secret.Holmes, then 24, was arrested at the scene by investigators who then discovered his apartment had been booby-trapped with explosives. His lawyers acknowledge Holmes, a former neuroscience doctorate student, was the lone shooter but say he was gripped by a psychotic episode.Legal analyst Scott Robinson said insanity-plea cases are rare, and it's even more unusual for a jury to find someone not guilty by reason of insanity.""It's a minuscule percentage ... yet the public perception is that people are getting off on the insanity plea all the time,"" said Robinson. ""It's actually a rare bird.""In December 2014 — just as jury summons went out — Holmes' parents issued a public statement begging prosecutors to drop the death penalty and give their son a plea deal that would see him locked up and treated.""We do not know how many victims of the theater shooting would like to see our son killed.

"The family of Michael Brown will file a civil lawsuit against the city of Ferguson, Missouri, and former Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, an attorney for the family announced Thursday.The news comes just one day after the U.S. Department of Justice officially announced its decision not to file federal charges against Wilson for fatally shooting Brown last July.In a press conference, family attorney Anthony Gray expressed the family’s disappointment in the Justice Department’s decision and announced the next legal actions they plan to take.“We are officially formulating a civil case that we anticipate will be filed very shortly on behalf of the family,” Gray said. “We plan to demonstrate in a court of law that Wilson’s choice to use deadly force was unreasonable and unnecessary.”Brown's parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr., attended the conference but did not make any comments. However, their frustration with the department's decision is widely shared by many local officials, residents and protesters -- some of whom took to the streets Wednesday evening to demonstrate their outrage.The criticism was further fueled by a scathing report released by the Justice Department, also on Wednesday. The report revealed that the city of Ferguson had engaged in unconstitutional patrolling practices that routinely discriminated against African-Americans. It also disclosed emails proving racial bias on behalf of Ferguson police officials.""[It] really just confirms what many of us already knew and what has been experienced by many African-Americans here in the St. Louis region for quite some time,"" St. Louis Alderman Antonio French told HuffPost Live on Wednesday, referring to the report.""Some of the specific details were shocking, [but] there's a culture that's been allowed to fester in Ferguson and one that's really been experienced by African-Americans for years and boiled over last year,"" French continued.Attorneys for the Brown family say they hope some level of accountability can be reached through the civil case. Meanwhile, French has taken the lead in calling for the resignation of the chief of the Ferguson Police Department.“I think some of the specific details outlined in this Department of Justice report really make it impossible for him to stay there,” he said. “When you have the culture that exists with these racist emails ... the stats alone suggest he needs to go.""",Formulate as an inspiring speech for high school students.,"Today, we witness the unwavering determination of the Brown family, as they embark on a journey for accountability and equality.The tragedy that unfolded in Ferguson, Missouri, last year, left an indelible mark on the hearts of all.

"A federal judge has given the world an unprecedented glimpse into the ruthless business practices Donald Trump used to build his business empire.US district court judge Gonzalo Curiel on Tuesday made public more than 400 pages of Trump University “playbooks” describing how Trump staff should target prospective students’ weaknesses to encourage them to sign up for a $34,995 Gold Elite three-day package.Trump University staff were instructed to get people to pile on credit card debt and to target their financial weaknesses in an attempt to sell them the high-priced real estate courses.The documents contained an undated “personal message” from Trump to new enrollees at the school: “Only doers get rich. I know that in these three packed days, you will learn everything to make a million dollars within the next 12 months.”The courses are now subject to legal proceedings from unhappy clients.Judge Curiel released the documents, which are central to a class-action lawsuit against Trump University in California, despite sustaining repeated public attacks from Trump, who had fought to keep the details secret.Curiel ruled that the documents were in the public interest now that Trump is “the front-runner in the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential race, and has placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue”.Trump hit back calling Curiel a “hater”, a “total disgrace” and “biased”. “I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump. A hater. He’s a hater,” Trump said at a rally near the courthouse in San Diego. “His name is Gonzalo Curiel. And he is not doing the right thing ... [He] happens to be, we believe, Mexican.”Curiel, who is Hispanic, is American and was born in Indiana.Trump went on to attack Curiel further on Twitter on Monday and at a press conference in New York on Monday.The playbook contains long sections telling Trump U team members how to identify buyers and push them to sign up for the most expensive package, and to put the cost on their credit cards.“If they can afford the gold elite don’t allow them to think about doing anything besides the gold elite,” the document states.If potential students hesitate, teachers are told to read this script.As one of your mentors for the last three days, it’s time for me to push you out of your comfort zone.

They are also told to ask students personal questions to discover weaknesses that could be exploited to help seal the deal.New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman, who has also sued Trump University, renewed his attacks on Trump on Tuesday. “You are not allowed to protect the trade secrets of a three-card Monte game,” Schneiderman said ahead of the document’s release. “If you look at the facts of this case, this shows someone who was absolutely shameless in his willingness to lie to people, to say whatever it took to induce them into his phony seminars,” Schneiderman said.","If applicable, rewrite the article to include detailed scientific explanations or insights related to the topic.",These documents describe the strategies used to target prospective students and encourage them to sign up for a high-priced real estate course.The playbook contains long sections detailing how to identify buyers and push them to sign up for the most expensive package.

"The Senate on Tuesday voted to block the controversial legislation cracking down on the so-called ""sanctuary cities"" that shield residents from federal immigration authorities.Following an impassioned speeches by Texas' Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and New Jersey's Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez arguing, respectively, for and against the Sanctuary Cities Bill, the Senate voted 54-46 against the legislation.The bill has divided Congress along partisan lines and gained national attention in the wake of GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump's harsh words on immigration and the shooting death of a California woman over the summer by an undocumented immigrant.""We are witnessing the most overtly nativist and xenophobic campaign in modern U.S. history,"" Menendez said on Tuesday. ""We've hit a new low with the extraordinarily hateful rhetoric that diminishes immigrants' contributions to American history — and particularly demonizes the Latino community by labeling Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals.""The bill, which went up for procedural vote on Tuesday, was authored by Louisiana Sen. David Vitter. It would have punished jurisdictions that prohibit the collection of immigration information or don't cooperate with federal requests, blocking them from receiving certain grants and funds.Republicans have pushed the bill since the July 1 shooting of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco. The man charged in the killing was in the country illegally despite a long criminal record and multiple prior deportations. The man, Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, had been released by San Francisco authorities despite a request from federal immigration authorities to keep him detained.""Today, the Senate had an opportunity to send the message that defiance of our laws will no longer be tolerated,"" Cruz said in a press release after the vote. ""While Senate Democrats chose partisan loyalty over protecting the lives of Americans, I will continue fighting to stop illegal immigration.""  He added: ""Defiance of our immigration laws is inexcusable. Sanctuary cities and the illegal reentry offenders that they harbor are a threat to the safety of the American people. And they must end now.""Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said before the vote that the bill would threaten cities' ability to police and compared it to Republican presidential candidate Trump's comments earlier this year that some immigrants in the country illegally are ""criminals"" and ""rapists.""""This vile legislation might as well be called 'The Donald Trump Act,'"" Reid said.San Francisco and hundreds of other jurisdictions nationally have adopted policies of disregarding federal immigration requests, or ""detainers,"" which advocates say can unfairly target innocent immigrants and hurt relations between immigrant communities and law enforcement authorities.The House passed legislation similar to Vitter's bill this summer, which the White House also threatened to veto. In its veto threat of the Senate legislation, the White House said the bill could lead to mistrust between the federal government and local governments.The Obama administration has said that the best way to get at the problem is comprehensive immigration overhaul, something House Republicans have blocked for years.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter & Instagram","Convert the news article into an opinion piece, providing a strong stance or viewpoint on the events or information discussed.","The Senate's decision to block the controversial Sanctuary Cities Bill is a testament to the ongoing debate over immigration in the United States.

"""A multi-party system is normal,"" says Richard Winger, publisher and editor of Ballot Access News. ""You only have a two party system if there's repression. It's not natural.""With both major parties offering up two of the most unpopular presidential candidates in modern history, many voters (and the media) are paying more attention to third party options such as Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Green Party nominee Jill Stein.But while independent candidates are gaining in popularity, getting them on the ballot to vote for them can be a long and costly process.""There's so many ways in which the United States is near the bottom of democracy,"" says Winger, an expert in election law and ballot access. ""There's been unbelievable hostility in the last few months to minor parties.""This hostility has resulted in states changing their ballot access rules—sometimes at the last minute—in an effort to exclude minor parties from the ballot.One recent example of this was Gary Johnson's fight to remain on the ballot as a presidential candidate in Ohio after the secretary of state threatened to remove his name thanks to a frequently used rule that allows placeholder candidates when fulfilling ballot access requirements (read more about the incident here.)""Ohio law explicitly says people who use the independent candidate petition procedure put a substitution committee on the petition,"" states Winger. But when it came time to remove the placeholder name and add Gary Johnson's, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted ""acted like he never heard of such a thing!"" Winger exclaimed.Johnson eventually qualified for the ballot as an independent candidate after his supporters turned in the necessary 5,000 petition signatures to Husted in late August.""They act like the secretary of state did the Libertarians a big favor by letting them use this thing which has been used all along,"" Winger says. ""It's just so maddening.""Reason TV recently sat down with Winger to discuss which states have the worst ballot access laws, why the major parties give independent candidates such a hard time when it comes to getting on the ballot, and the consequences of a two party duopoly.""This is one the things that anchors me being a libertarian,"" says Winger.

"The Senate worked late into the night Friday and early Saturday, but still failed to agree on extending government surveillance programs under the USA Patriot Act before the Memorial Day holiday.Lawmakers blocked votes on both a House-passed bill and a short-term extension of the Patriot Act provisions that allow government surveillance programs.Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says lawmakers will try again on May 31, the day before the provisions expire.The Senate first took up the House bill, which would end the National Security Agency's bulk collection of domestic phone records. That bill, passed overwhelmingly by the House and supported by the Obama administration, required a 60-vote majority to proceed. It fell three votes short.The Senate then failed to advance a two-month extension of the expiring Patriot Act provision that would extend the NSA phone records program. That vote was seven short of the required 69 votes, reports NPR Washington desk senior editor Shirley Henry.Sen. Majority Leader McConnell tried to secure unanimous consent agreements on a number of measures aimed at preventing the program from lapsing on June 1, when the Patriot Act provision expires, Henry reports.McConnell first proposed a measure to extend the act to June 8. But Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican presidential contender, objected, saying he wants two amendments debated and voted on.""Our forefathers would be aghast,"" Paul said.Henry reports that McConnell then tried for an extension to June 5, but there was an objection. His proposal for June 3 met another objection; then Paul objected to a June 2 extension, Henry says.Unable to get agreement on any extension, McConnell said the Senate will come back at 4 p.m. on May 31 to try again, beginning with a vote on the House bill. That gives lawmakers only a few hours to prevent the Patriot Act provisions from expiring.The majority leader stressed that it's a dangerous time to allow the law to expire, given the threats overseas and attempted attacks here, and urged the Senate to act ""responsibly"" to protect the country, Henry reports.The Justice Department has said the NSA would begin winding down collection of domestic phone records this week if the Senate failed to act, according to the Associated Press.","Compose the article as a debate, presenting opposing viewpoints on the issues discussed.","The debate surrounding the extension of government surveillance programs under the USA Patriot Act highlights the ongoing tension between privacy and national security.

"THE STING videos targeting Planned Parenthood are hard to watch. Doctors talk clinically, some say callously, about harvesting fetal tissue. Technicians identify and isolate tiny organs. References are made to “it’s a baby” or “it’s another boy.” The videos were taken surreptitiously and were artfully edited to produce maximum discomfort about complicated issues that, for many, are inherently uncomfortable.That truths were distorted to paint an inaccurate and unfair picture of a health organization that provides valuable services to women — as well as to demonize research that leads to important medical advances — doesn’t matter to antiabortion activists. Or, sadly, to the politicians who pander to them.Planned Parenthood is under virulent attack for the role a small portion of its affiliates play in helping women who want to donate fetal tissue for medical research. The antiabortion group Center for Medical Progress has orchestrated a propaganda campaign accusing the nation’s largest provider of abortions of profiting from the illegal sale of fetal tissue, a charge refuted by Planned Parenthood.None of the videos released shows anything illegal and, in fact, the full footage of Planned Parenthood executives meeting with people presumed to be buyers for a human biologics company include repeated assertions that clinics are not selling tissue but only seeking permitted reimbursement costs for expenses. Indeed, the Colorado clinic featured in the videos refused to enter into a contract with the phony company because of its failure to meet its legal and ethical standards.Such facts, though, haven’t stopped officials in several Republican-led states, including Texas, Louisiana and Ohio, from launching investigations of Planned Parenthood, even though affiliates in those states don’t facilitate fetal tissue donations. In Washington, Senate Republicans have fast-tracked a bid to defund Planned Parenthood, with a vote set for Monday. Fortunately, it’s unlikely there will be 60 votes to advance the bill, as cutting off funds to Planned Parenthood would be irresponsible.No federal money is used by Planned Parenthood to provide abortions except in some rare exceptions. So cutting off government funds, mostly through Medicaid and grants, would only hurt the thousands of people, most of them low-income women, who each day depend upon Planned Parenthood for birth control, cancer screenings, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and other health services. Given that many of the clinics are in medically underserved areas, it’s a myth, as Republicans claim, that other providers can fill the gap. Shutting down clinics would make it harder for many women to obtain birth control — and the last thing either side of the abortion debate should want is an increase in unwanted pregnancies that result in more abortions.We are under no illusions that the vendetta against Planned Parenthood will end. Conservative Republicans are already threatening to shut down the federal government in the fall by blocking any spending that includes money for Planned Parenthood. It’s clear from how quickly Republican presidential hopefuls seized on the issue that it will be a staple of the campaign trail. Consequently, it’s important that congressional Democrats and others continue to stand up for Planned Parenthood and the women whose health depends upon its services.","Reimagine the article as a speculative fiction story, incorporating futuristic elements or technology.","The futuristic medical landscape of the year 2042 cast a somber shadow over the controversial issue of fetal tissue donation. Planned Parenthood, a beacon of reproductive health, found itself embroiled in a tempest of misinformation and political maneuvering.The organization's state-of-the-art facilities and compassionate doctors were shrouded in a veil of disturbing videos that painted a distorted picture of its operations. Technicians meticulously identified and isolated tiny organs, their voices echoing through the halls"
"After the Paris attacks, Americans are divided on Obama’s plan to let in 10,000 Syrian refugees. The timing is good: Thanksgiving can shed light on how much the nation’s tradition of hospitality should influence this decision.Syria refugee Nedal Al-Hayk works as a fabricator in Warren, Mich. Several U.S. governors are threatening to halt efforts to allow Syrian refugees into their states in the aftermath of the coordinated attacks in Paris, though an immigration expert says they have no legal authority to do so.Just as Americans prepare to express their hospitality toward others during Thanksgiving, a national debate has erupted over another kind of hospitality: President Obama’s plan to welcome 10,000 Syrian refugees into the United States. After the Paris attacks, the plan has been widely challenged, not least by nearly half the US governors. They fear Islamic State terrorists might slip in as “sleepers” among the refugees. Others argue back that the US already rigorously vets all asylum seekers – for as long as two years.Might Thanksgiving, with all its traditions and meaning, shed some light on this debate?The practice of welcoming strangers into one’s home or community long precedes the first American thanksgiving, that autumn feast of 1621 when Pilgrims and native Americans expressed gratitude for either the harvest, each other, or God’s mercy (or all of the above). Hospitality is an ancient Middle East virtue, rooted in the traditions of desert tribes and deeply encoded in the three Abrahamic religions. In the scriptural book of Hebrews, we read: “Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.”Hospitality, like Thanksgiving, is a type of giving that treats others – rich or poor, stranger or family – as equals. In ancient days, this egalitarian focus was symbolized by the washing of a guest’s feet. Today it serves as a cornerstone for democracy. It is also the basis for the United Nations Refugee Convention, in which a majority of the world’s states have agreed to grant asylum to people deemed to be refugees.In the US, a thanksgiving day was not an official holiday until Lincoln made it one during the Civil War. The woman who championed it, Sarah Hale, wrote in 1864: “Let us each see to it that on this one day there shall be no family or individual, within the compass of our means to help, who shall not have some portion prepared, and some reason to join in the general Thanksgiving.”Granting permanent asylum in the US to a refugee, of course, is not the same as sharing a turkey dinner with a stranger. Today’s modern nation-states are careful about who crosses their borders, either to prevent problems or to enhance their society. But with 1 in every 122 people now either a refugee, internally displaced, or seeking asylum, the need for hospitality is great.

It certifies that the person who signs it has turned over all ""classified or administratively controlled"" materials, as well as all ""unclassified documents and papers"" relating to official government business.Given that Clinton exclusively used personal email while secretary of state and didn't turn over official records until late last year, a former Justice Department official said last week that if Clinton signed that form, she probably gave a false statement and broke the law.But on Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters they are ""fairly certain she did not"" sign it.""We have reviewed Secretary Clinton's official personnel file and administrative files and do not have any record of her signing the OF109 [form],"" Psaki said.This admission comes after the department for days was unable to answer questions about whether Clinton signed the form.It also raises questions about whether Clinton, by not signing it, at least violated department policy.Psaki claimed Clinton did not violate any policy. Further, she said Tuesday that neither of Clinton's two immediate predecessors, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, signed such a statement either.She also said that different bureaus within the department had different rules relating to such statements that had the effect of making their completion optional by some employees.Shannen Coffin, a senior lawyer under the George W. Bush administration, first cited the form OF109 in questioning whether Clinton committed a violation by exclusively using personal email as secretary of state, and then not turning over those emails deemed work-related until after leaving the department.If she indeed signed the document, he told Fox News last week, ""there's no question [she broke the law].""And if Clinton did not sign that document, he added, ""why not?""The Associated Press contributed to this report.","Reframe the text as a magic spell or incantation, weaving the story's elements into a mystical formula.","""In the name of the Great Spirit of the State Department, I cast this spell, a spell of truth and clarity.""I summon the power of the OF109 form, a document of surrender and disclosure.

"Employers aren’t dropping their health benefits in the numbers once anticipated, and programs created by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will be slower to reach full enrollment than the budget office expects, the Department of Health and Human Services said today in a report. That equates to between 9 million and 9.9 million people enrolled through new government-run insurance markets created by the law.Coming in below the CBO estimate would undermine the Obama administration’s effort to convince the public that its signature domestic policy initiative is working. It’s possible the administration is just giving itself an easier goal to beat, said Dan Mendelson, the chief executive officer of Avalere Health, a Washington consulting firm.“If you set low expectations, you’re less likely to disappoint,” he said. “To me, these are low expectations. We expect the numbers to come in higher.”The insurance markets, called exchanges, are designed to allow people who don’t have coverage through an employer to compare prices and buy a health plan, often with the assistance of government subsidies for monthly premiums. Enrollment opens for 2015 on Nov. 15 and closes Feb. 15, a window that is three months shorter than last year.Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the HHS secretary, said she’ll consider enrollment to be a success this year if the U.S. uninsured rate continues to decline. About 13.4 percent of Americans are without coverage this year, according to Gallup Inc., the lowest rate the organization has reported since it started tracking the figure in 2008.“We want to make progress on that fundamental number of reducing the uninsured,” Burwell said at an event held by the Center for American Progress, a Democrat-aligned advocacy group. “We do have a shorter period of time and we’re moving to a group of people that will be harder to reach.”At least three out of four people who sign up for the exchanges for the first time this year will have been previously uninsured, according to the administration’s projection.HHS expects 83 percent of the 7.1 million people covered as of last month to re-enroll this year, Burwell said.The U.S. website where people can sign up for coverage, healthcare.gov, opened yesterday in a “window shopping” mode that lets people see what plans they can buy for next year.The preview feature, added to the revamped website, is intended to ease pressure on the system by letting curious consumers look at prices for health plans a week before enrollment begins. Last year, consumers who tried to use the website were met with errors and delays that prevented millions from signing up for several months.Challenges are mounting for the second year of enrollment as Republicans gained control of Congress last week and the Supreme Court announced it will consider whether a key feature, subsidies to reduce the cost of insurance, should be available to all Americans. Consumers should be confident that the high court will rule in favor of the administration, Burwell said today, allowing the subsidies to continue.“The administration has been clear all along we believe that is the intention of the law,” Burwell said, responding to a question from former Ohio Governor Ted Strickland. “That is where we will stay and be.”","Conceive as a children's book story, simplifying complex ideas into engaging narratives.","The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) has created new health insurance markets called exchanges that allow people to compare prices and buy a health plan.

"After Russian President Vladimir Putin complimented Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate lavished praise on the heavy-handed leader and U.S. adversary.Trump said Friday on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" that, ""sure"" he's happy about the nice things Putin said about him.""When people call you 'brilliant' it's always good, especially when the person heads up Russia,"" Trump said.After the program's hosts pointed out that Putin kills journalists, political opponents and invades countries, Trump still embraced the Russian leader.""At least he's a leader unlike what we have in this country,"" Trump said.After the hosts repeated that he kills journalists and political opponents, Trump still avoided criticizing Putin.""Our country does plenty of killing also,"" Trump added.Earlier this week, Putin said Trump is a ""bright personality, a talented person, no doubt about it.""""It is always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond,"" Trump said in a statement.Putin has become a main adversary to the U.S. Tensions escalated once Putin re-entered office in 2012.

"In the end, elections usually come back to the economy—to jobs, wages, taxes, imports and exports, the price of goods and the cost of an education.

"President Obama on Tuesday followed through on his vow to veto bipartisan-backed legislation authorizing the Keystone XL pipeline, marking his first veto of the Republican-led Congress and only the third of his presidency.The president, in a brief statement, claimed the bill would ""circumvent"" the existing process for reviewing the pipeline, which would extend from Canada to Texas.""The Presidential power to veto legislation is one I take seriously,"" Obama said. ""But I also take seriously my responsibility to the American people. And because this act of Congress conflicts with established executive branch procedures and cuts short thorough consideration of issues that could bear on our national interest -- including our security, safety, and environment -- it has earned my veto.""The decision, while expected, was met with tough criticism from Republicans -- and tees up another showdown with Congress in the coming days as GOP leaders try to override.""It's extremely disappointing that President Obama vetoed a bipartisan bill that would support thousands of good jobs and pump billions of dollars into the economy,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement. ""Even though the President has yielded to powerful special interests, this veto doesn't end the debate.""McConnell's office said the Senate plans to vote on overriding sometime before March 3.But so far, congressional leaders have not demonstrated they have the votes to override, which takes a two-thirds majority in both chambers.The Keystone bill garnered 62 yeas in the Senate, but they would need 67 to override. In the House, the bill got 270 votes -- but they would need 281 to override.It remains unclear whether moderate lawmakers could be swayed to switch in the coming weeks.While Tuesday's veto marked only the third of Obama's presidency -- fewer than any U.S. president since the 19th century -- his sparing use of the presidential tool is likely to change. With Republicans now in control of Congress, their efforts to chip away at the president's health care law and other legislative accomplishments are just as likely to be met with Obama's veto pen.To date, Obama rarely has used the veto in part because Democrats for six years controlled at least one chamber in Congress -- acting as a buffer to prevent unwanted bills from ever reaching the president's desk. That buffer is now gone.A look back at past presidencies, especially where control of the White House and Congress was split during at least one point, shows far more liberal use of that presidential power.In the Clinton presidency, the president issued 37 vetoes in his two terms. President Ronald Reagan issued 78. President George W. Bush issued 12. His father issued 44.Not since the Warren G. Harding administration has the number of vetoes been in the single digits; Harding issued six.The Keystone bill is as contentious an issue as any for Obama to fire his first veto shot of the new Congress.First proposed in 2008, the Keystone pipeline would connect Canada's tar sands to Gulf Coast refineries.The White House has said repeatedly it would wait to make its decision about whether to let the project go forward until after a State Department review. It regards the legislation as circumventing that process.The Associated Press contributed to this report.","Transform the article into a fantasy tale, with elements of magic or myth intertwined with real events.","In the realm of the emerald hills and towering towers, President Obama, a master of the arcane arts, cast his spell upon the land, wielding his veto pen with the power of a dragon.

"WASHINGTON, June 21 (Reuters) - Tensions are building inside and outside the white marble facade of the U.S. Supreme Court building as the nine justices prepare to issue major rulings on gay marriage and President Barack Obama's healthcare law by the end of the month.Of the 11 cases left to decide, the biggest are a challenge by gay couples to state laws banning same-sex marriage and a conservative challenge to subsidies provided under the Obamacare law to help low- and middle-income people buy health insurance that could lead to millions of people losing medical coverage.Many legal experts predict the court will legalize gay marriage nationwide by finding that the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of equal treatment under the law and due process prohibit states from banning same-sex nuptials.In three key decisions since 1996, Kennedy has broadened the court's view of equality for gays. The most recent was a 2013 case in which the court struck down a federal law denying benefits to married same-sex couples.During oral arguments in the gay marriage case on April 28, Kennedy posed tough questions to lawyers from both sides but stressed the nobility and dignity of same-sex couples.The healthcare decision is tougher to call. Chief Justice John Roberts, the swing vote when the court upheld Obamacare in 2012, said little during the March 4 oral argument to indicate how he will vote.The court will issue some rulings on Monday, with more likely later in the week.For the justices, the pressure is on to have the rulings ready. That can be difficult as the cases in which they are closely divided are generally the ones left until the end.James Obergefell, one of the plaintiffs in the gay marriage case, said he will be at the court for all the remaining decision days.Obergefell sued Ohio, challenging its ban on same-sex marriages, after the state refused to acknowledge his marriage to John Arthur on Arthur's death certificate. They were married in Maryland, a state that allows gay marriages, just months before Arthur died in 2013.The Supreme Court does not announce in advance which rulings will be issued on any given day.""It's nerve-racking, it's exciting, but it's also scary,"" Obergefell said while waiting in line to enter the courtroom on Thursday.On the other side of the issue, the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian group that opposes gay marriage, will have at least two attorneys in the courtroom, spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.As for the closed-door deliberations at the court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg hinted during a June 12 speech at the turmoil to come. ""Sharp divisions, one can confidently predict, will rise in the term's final weeks,"" Ginsburg said.Prior to June 15, the court was split 5-4 in only seven of the 46 cases decided at that point. But last week alone, four of the nine rulings were 5-4 decisions. In the rulings, several justices wrote separate opinions in which they aimed pointed comments at their colleagues.","Rewrite the text as a series of tweets, capturing the essence of the story in short messages.","**Tweet 1:**Tensions are high at the Supreme Court as they prepare to issue major rulings on gay marriage and healthcare.

"That’s not to say that his campaign was especially successful. Many observers felt Kasich was pursuing a replay of former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman’s failed 2012 bid for the Republican nomination. Huntsman and Kasich even shared a campaign architect, the heterodox GOP strategist John Weaver. The playbook may have gotten Kasich farther than it did Huntsman, but that still wasn’t enough to win the nomination, or even to come close. (As for Huntsman, he now backs Trump .)While hardly anyone predicted Trump’s success in the Republican campaign, few expected Kasich would get this far either. In a crowd of young, charismatic GOP figures, Kasich was the odd man out, a somewhat more grizzled figure who had run abortively for president in 2000, and a comparatively moderate figure in a party trending increasingly to the right. Somehow, Kasich managed to hold on to the bitter end, the final challenger to Trump.The Ohio governor’s exit leaves Donald Trump as the last man standing in the Republican field. Though he’d already assumed the mantle of presumptive nominee with Senator Ted Cruz’s exit Tuesday night —after Trump trounced both of them in the Indiana primary—Kasich’s exit seals the deal. Kasich has been mentioned for weeks as a potential vice-presidential candidate for Trump, who will need to shore up his policy and political credentials ahead of the general election.John Kasich will end his bid for the presidency Wednesday afternoon in Columbus, according to multiple reports. Kasich had planned to hold a press conference at Dulles Aiport near Washington Wednesday morning, but he never took off—perhaps an apt metaphor—staying home and scheduling a press conference for 5 p.m., where he is expected to make his announcement.For a time, before Trump’s ascendancy became inevitable, Kasich’s plan seemed plausible. In New Hampshire, the nation’s first primary and second nominating contest, he placed (a distant) second to Trump, and hoped to portray himself as the reasonable alternative to the entertainer. But having placed a huge bet on the Granite State, Kasich had little infrastructure in place for the rest of the campaign, and was a non-entity in the South Carolina primary. By the time the campaign reached his home state, Kasich was effectively out of the running. Ohio turned out to be the only state that he won. He closes out the campaign with fewer delegates than Senator Marco Rubio, who dropped out on March 15.Kasich’s sell to voters was that amid a sea of volatile, unpredictable characters like Trump and wild-eyed radicals like Cruz, he was an old-style true conservative who could also win swing states like Ohio. To the extent that his campaign had a policy theme, it was his advocacy for a balanced-budget amendment—a vague promise, tethered to his work on balancing the national budget while in the U.S. House in the 1990s. (Opinions about just how central Kasich had been in that work differed widely.)But some of his other policy stances were at odds with much of the Republican Party. As governor, he had circumvented the GOP-led Ohio legislature to accept Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. As though that were not bad enough, he compounded his offense in the eyes of conservatives by justifying his choice by faith. “Now, when you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, he’s probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small,” he said. “But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor. You better have a good answer.’”Many of Kasich’s former colleagues viewed his image as a soft, cuddly, friendly politician with skepticism—they remembered a more irritable, angry Kasich—it seemed to take with many voters. The problem was that Republican primary voters didn’t want a sane, rational nominee in 2016. They wanted a Trump.","Develop as a script for a 5-minute documentary, including narrator lines and interview quotes.","Here is a rewritten version that includes narrator lines and interview quotes:**Narrator:**""That's not to say that Kasich's campaign was especially successful.

"Obama On Climate Change: 'I Actually Think We're Going To Solve This Thing'""I actually think we're going to solve this thing.""That's what President Obama said in a news conference just before he left a United Nations summit on climate change.""Climate change is a massive problem,"" Obama said. ""It is a generational problem. It's a problem that by definition is just about the hardest thing for a political system to absorb, because the effects are gradual, they're diffused. And yet despite all that ... I'm optimistic. I think we're going to solve it.""Just a few years ago, Obama said, nobody would have predicted that more than 150 leaders would come to Paris holding plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions.""All of this will be hard,"" Obama said. ""Getting 200 nations to agree on anything is hard ... but I'm convinced that we're going to get big things done here.""Obama leaves the conference, but his deputies will remain in Paris in an effort to craft a global, legally binding agreement intended to curb climate change. The big goal: to keep the global temperature from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius.At the moment, if you add up all the commitments on the table at the summit and assume that they would be met, the temperature would still rise by 2.7 degrees, Obama said.""That's too high,"" Obama said. But ""what we expect is that we'll hit these targets faster than expected and ... we could pick up the pace.""Obama said that is not just ""foolish optimism"" but an expectation based on past experience. The United States, for example, was able to meet its goals faster than expected.""The key here is to set up the structure so we're sending signals all around the world that says this is happening and we're not turning around,"" Obama said.Obama touched on a whole host of other issues during the conference. Here are a couple of highlights:— Obama says that the fact that the peace process for Syria is progressing in Vienna is a sign that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""realizes there is not going to be a military solution to the situation in Syria.""Eventually, Obama said, he expects the Russians to shift their focus in Syria from trying to prop up the regime of Bashar Assad to fighting the Islamic State.""I think Mr. Putin understands that for him to get bogged down in an inconclusive and paralyzing civil conflict is not the outcome that he is looking for,"" Obama said.In other words, Obama said, both the U.S. and Russia agree that the only lasting solution in Syria will be political.""Where we continue to have an ongoing difference is not in the need for a political settlement; it's whether Assad can continue to serve as president as that transition goes on,"" Obama said.Russia believes Assad should play a role, and Obama believes that ""it is impossible for Mr. Assad to bring that country together.""— On the shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado, Obama said Congress should act. Just as the country takes huge, costly steps to fight terrorism, it has to take steps to reduce gun homicides.""At the end of the day, Congress, states, local governments are going to have to act in order to make sure that we are preventing people who are deranged or have violent tendencies"" from getting weapons that magnify the damage that they can do, Obama said.Earlier in the day, President Obama urged Turkey and Russia to ease tensions by focusing on a common enemy: the Islamic State.The relationship between the two countries has been frayed since Turkey downed a Russian jet in November. Turkey has refused to apologize, saying the Russian warplane crossed over into Turkish airspace. Russia has implemented a series of sanctions.Reuters reports that Obama said the United States supported Turkey's right to defend its airspace, but he also urged the two countries to ""de-escalate tensions.""""We all have a common enemy. That is ISIL,"" Obama said using an acronym for the Islamic State, according to the AP. ""I want to make sure that we focus on that threat.""","Rewrite the text as a codex or ancient scroll, giving it a historical or mystical aura.","O mighty scroll of ancient wisdom, bearing the ink of a leader's heart, I present unto you the words of a man of vision, a man of courage, a man of hope named Barack Obama.In this era of uncertainty, where the winds of change blow wild and the tides of fate rage on, Obama's voice echoes through the halls of history.

The Capitol Police and other agencies already are under scrutiny over the incident last month where a man breached restricted airspace and landed a gyrocopter next to the Capitol.The incidents involving misplaced firearms were detailed in a report being reviewed by the Capitol Police Board.The newspaper Roll Call, which first reported the incidents, said one of the guns -- allegedly left by a member of House Speaker John Boehner's detail in a bathroom in March -- was found by a 7- or 8-year-old child.Another was found stuffed in a restroom stall in the Capitol Visitor's Center in January. It was discovered by a Capitol worker and belonged to a member of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's security detail.Custodial staff located a third weapon two weeks ago at the Capitol Police headquarters.These firearms are Glocks and do not have conventional ""safeties"" on them -- they will fire if the trigger is pulled.The concerns come as congressional officials are closely scrutinizing USCP Chief Kim Dine.

"U.S. counterterrorism officials are reviewing databases of known terror suspects and other materials after the deadly Paris shooting Wednesday morning, as the Obama administration opened the door to increasing security in the U.S. in response.The terror attack on a satirical French publication known for lampooning Islam left at least 12 dead, and the attackers remain at large. U.S. officials already are in touch with their French counterparts.The attackers reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar,"" Arabic for ""God is great, before escaping.Two French officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, named the suspects to the Associated Press as Frenchmen Said Kouachi and Cherif Kouachi, in their early 30s, as well as 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad, whose nationality wasn't immediately clear.One of the officials said they were linked to a Yemeni terrorist network.All three remain at large.Cherif Kouachi was convicted in 2008 of terrorism charges for helping funnel fighters to Iraq's insurgency and sentenced to 18 months in prison.Fox News is told investigators had been reviewing terror databases, including for individuals who have traveled to Syria. They also looked to closed-circuit television and evidence from the crime scene.In addition to identifying the suspects, the focus will be on determining whether this is isolated or part of a series of attacks.It is thought to be an attack carried out by a small cell, which distinguishes this from recent lone-wolf attacks, including one in Ottawa, Canada, and another more recent attack in Sydney, Australia. Officials are looking at the level of premeditation, given eyewitness accounts that the gunmen asked for individuals by name as they stormed the office.In addition, Fox News is told the assailants showed skill and familiarity with their weapons, and their escape also showed premeditation.A Department of Homeland Security official told Fox News that the department is ""closely monitoring"" the situation.""DHS will not hesitate to adjust our security posture, as appropriate, to protect the American people,"" the official said, urging the public to report suspicious activity to law enforcement.However, the office of the U.S. Embassy in France tweeted that there are ""no plans"" to close the embassy in Paris or other diplomatic facilities in France despite ""misleading"" press reports.U.S. investigators are expected to get more formally involved, but only after a request from the French government.Based on conversations with government officials and analysts, they are looking at three categories of suspects: self-radicalized individuals; members of Al Qaeda and its affiliates, specifically Al Qaeda's offshoot in North Africa known as AQIM; and those who have traveled to Syria and gotten training from Al Qaeda or the Islamic State.The latest edition of Inspire magazine, from the Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen, calls for attacks on France, as well as America and other allies.Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., told Fox News he has confidence in French authorities who are pursuing suspects as well. ""I would think that one way or the other, they will find them,"" he said.King also said the attack should be a ""wake-up call"" for Congress not to cut funding for DHS, despite an ongoing fight over funding the administration's immigration initiatives.Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C.

"WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - Republican senators warned Iran on Monday that any nuclear deal made with U.S. President Barack Obama could last only as long as he remains in office, in an unusual intervention into U.S. foreign policy-making.The letter, signed by 47 U.S. senators, says Congress plays a role in ratifying international agreements and points out that Obama will leave office in January 2017, while many in Congress will remain in Washington long after that.""We will consider any agreement regarding your nuclear-weapons program that is not approved by the Congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei,"" the letter read.""The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of an agreement at any time,"" it read.The letter, first reported by Bloomberg News, followed a speech to a joint meeting of Congress last week by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who warned that the United States was negotiating a ""bad deal"" with Tehran.It comes as world powers have been negotiating with Iran to try to reach some form of understanding by the end of March before a final deal in June that could ease crippling sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy.The U.S. Constitution divides foreign policy powers between the president and Congress. The executive branch is responsible for negotiating international agreements and lawmakers rarely intervene directly with the leaders of another nation while the president's administration is negotiating a pact.Republicans want any U.S. nuclear agreement with Iran to be approved by Congress. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who signed the letter released on Monday, agreed to postpone a vote on a bill requiring Obama to submit any deal for congressional approval amid outcry from Democrats.Along with McConnell, Republican signers include Tom Cotton, Orrin Hatch, John Cornyn, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, John Thune and Mark Kirk.

"President Barack Obama said the U.S. and its allies must strip away any legitimacy that Islamic State and al-Qaeda claim by portraying themselves as religious movements.Obama, who has come under criticism from Republicans who say he avoids acknowledging the Muslim roots of extremist groups, said terrorists use religion as a recruiting tool by portraying the U.S. and European nations as being at war with Islam.“We must never accept the premise they put forward, because it is a lie,” Obama said Wednesday in Washington on the second day of a White House summit on combating extremism. “They are not religious leaders. They’re terrorists. And we are not at war with Islam. We are at war with people who have perverted Islam.”Deadly attacks in Paris, Sydney and Copenhagen by individuals of Muslim background and possibly inspired by the brutal tactics of Islamic State, along with the group’s spread in Syria, Iraq and now Libya, have raised alarms in Europe and the U.S. about the danger of lone-wolf terrorists, driven by extremist ideology and difficult to detect before they act.At the summit, the Obama administration is convening representatives of Muslim organizations, law enforcement officials and local political leaders to swap ideas about how to stem root causes of extremism. It also has invited leaders from overseas to take part.Obama said civic leaders must recognize that Islamic State and al-Qaeda “deliberately target their propaganda in the hopes of reaching and brainwashing young Muslims” through videos, social media and other online outlets. He said the one way to counter that is to alleviate the alienation and poverty that are the extremists’ best recruiting tool.In the U.S., he said, local and federal authorities must make sure that Muslims aren’t isolated and that they are welcomed and integrated into society.“Muslim Americans feel they have been unfairly targeted,” he said. “We have to be sure that abuses stop, are not repeated, that we do not stigmatize entire communities.”Former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore, who is chairman of a political action committee aimed at electing Republicans, called the conference a “farce” in a statement and said the administration should be targeting terrorists rather than offering “pie-in-the-sky social welfare programs” to Muslims here and overseas.The administration’s strategy is also aimed at drawing in the domestic Muslim leaders who Obama is leaning on to identify and isolate potentially violent extremists. Yet some groups say they remain suspicious about the administration’s motivation.The Muslim Advocates, an Oakland Calif.-based group that that was invited to a White House meeting earlier this month, expressed concern that Obama’s requests for “partnerships” with Muslim community and religious leaders is code for requiring leaders to play a law enforcement role.They also blasted Obama for focusing too narrowly on Muslims, a decision that the group says reinforces a negative stereotype that Islam and terror are linked.“This whole day is focused on American Muslims, frankly,” Farhana Khera, the group’s executive director, said in a telephone interview. “It strikes at the core of what we are as Americans.”Obama is speaking on the topic again tomorrow at the State Department during a session that includes representatives from overseas, including France, Belgium, Mexico and Japan.","Rewrite the article focusing on its impact at a local level, even if the original story has national or international significance.","The President's speech on combating extremism primarily focused on its impact at a local level, even though the original story has national and international significance.

"In a marketing fiasco that could rank right up there with “New Coke,” Starbucks has ditched its plan to have baristas ignite a national discussion on race after critics advised the chain its view of black and white should revolve around coffee and milk.The baristas had begun writing ""Race Together"" on customers' cups, as a means of starting a conversation with customers, but the practice ended Sunday after just one week, said company spokesman Jim Olson. But the chain's initiative will continue more broadly without the handwritten messages, Starbucks spokesman Jim Olson said.The cups were always ""just the catalyst"" for a larger conversation and Starbucks will still hold forum discussions, co-produce special sections in USA Today and put more stores in minority communities as part of the Race Together initiative, according to a company memo from CEO Howard Schultz said.The campaign has been criticized as opportunistic and inappropriate, coming in the wake of racially charged events such as national protests over police killings of black males. Others questioned whether Starbucks workers could spark productive conversations about race while serving drinks.The critics blasted Corey duBrowa, the company's senior vice president of global communications, on Twitter after the plan was first announced, calling it patronizing at best and inflammatory at worst. The executive was forced to delete his Twitter account, although he re-activated it the next day.“Last night I felt personally attacked in a cascade of negativity,” he tweeted. “I got overwhelmed by the volume and tenor of the discussion, and I reacted.”The phase-out is not a reaction to that pushback, Olson said. ""Nothing is changing. It's all part of the cadence of the timeline we originally planned.""He echoed the company memo, saying of the Race Together initiative, ""We're leaning into it hard.""Schultz's note acknowledged the skeptics as an anticipated part of the outreach.""While there has been criticism of the initiative -- and I know this hasn't been easy for any of you -- let me assure you that we didn't expect universal praise,"" it read.He said the campaign at its core aims to make sure that ""the promise of the American Dream should be available to every person in this country, not just a select few.""The Associated Press contributed to this report.",Reframe the text as an open letter to a public figure or organization mentioned in the story.,"As a customer and advocate for inclusivity, I understand the intention behind the initiative to spark a national conversation on race.

"The water crisis in Flint, Mich., is just the tip of the iceberg – and if you think that it can’t happen in your community, you’re sadly mistaken. The aging water infrastructure in this country is deeply flawed. Many of the 150,000 public water systems that serve more than 300 million people are based on rusting, leaky pipes and decades-old plans that— if not corrected and replaced— will have devastating and long-lasting effects on our communities.The disaster in Flint, which began in 2014 when the city switched its water supply from Detroit’s system to the Flint River in a cost-saving measure, is likely brewing in many other communities. It is inconceivable to me that in the most developed nation on the planet, we have exposed families and young children to the poisonous effects of lead. And it is almost criminal to me that water supply officials were unaware that the water pumping through a large American city was endangering the community. That level of negligence is beyond comprehension.The dangerous, detrimental effects that lead can have on a developing brain and body are well-documented. In 1978, a largely successful campaign to remove lead from home paint products resulted in a new law, after it was found that small children could mistakenly eat paint chips and be exposed to lead poisoning. When it comes to levels of lead in water, no true amount is safe. However, in 1991 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established an action level for lead in public drinking water at 15 micrograms per liter, and required water supplies to routinely test household tap water to check lead levels.These laws and others were established to protect our citizens from both indirect and direct exposure to the harmful compound. A person can be directly exposed to lead by drinking contaminated water with unsafe levels, while indirect exposure can occur when a person inhales contaminated water particles through steam or vapors.Once lead enters the human body, the heavy metal attaches itself to cells that can begin to build up in bones or major organs like the liver or kidneys. It disrupts the normal cellular biology of the organ and can lead to chronic diseases. However, the most dangerous damage lead poisoning can inflict is on the brain, especially in young or unborn children. If lead is deposited in a developing fetal brain, it can disrupt the normal function and cause irreversible damage. The same can happen in young children whose brains are still maturing.The consequences can result in low IQ, severe delays in cognitive function, significant disruption in the memory center of the brain, learning disabilities and other neurological deficits. The devastating part of this diagnosis is that it is, for the most part, irreversible. Patients exposed to acute lead poisoning can be treated through chelation, which is a method used to filter out the lead. However, for children chronically exposed over a period of time, the damage cannot be undone.This makes the preventable crisis in Flint all the more devastating.I read that the Obama administration is planning to pick Dr. Nicole Lurie to act as a “czar” and fix the crisis in Flint, but I urge her to look further than just Michigan. Lurie and others must start to seriously evaluate other areas of America where the people are most susceptible to a disaster such as this. The government failed the city of Flint, it must act now to protect the rest of us.Dr. Manny Alvarez serves as Fox News Channel's senior managing health editor.

"Two women with an interest in violent jihad were arrested in Queens, New York, Thursday morning as part of an FBI sting, after allegedly plotting to create explosive devices to use in a terrorist attack in the United States.Noelle Velentzas, 28, and Asia Siddiqui, 31, had allegedly taken several steps toward constructing an explosive device and discussed their activities with an undercover officer, according to court documents. They had not yet identified a target for their planned attack, federal authorities said. The defendants are U.S. citizens who live in Queens and were roommates until recently.During regular meetings between the two women and the undercover agent, both women espoused jihadist beliefs and praised past terrorist attacks in the United States. Velentzas allegedly showed the officer her cell phone, which had a background image of Osama bin Laden holding an AK-47. Siddiqui once said that Velentzas had been obsessed with pressure cookers since the Boston Marathon bombings, and Velentzas joked about how she planned to cook ""food"" in a pressure cooker she had recently purchased.It appears Velentzas eventually became suspicious of the undercover agent's identity, allegedly using her phone in November and December to access webpages with titles like ""Learning the Identity of a Confidential Informant,"" ""How to Spot Undercover Police,"" ""Is S/he an Informant?"" She also researched how to detect bugs.Yet she and Siddiqui continued to meet with the agent in the months that followed. Siddiqui purchased several propane tanks and stored them in her basement, and discussed them during the meetings. ""I got everything up in this joint, I already told you. If you guys... once we learn... I got everything up in this joint,"" she allegedly said. ""Yo, she got everything. This is like the Home Depot,"" the undercover agent responded.Velentzas then asked Siddiqui why she hadn't told them that she had purchased the tanks, but Siddiqui insisted she had. ""She's the master of not telling you shit that's really important,"" Velentzas said, later telling the undercover agent that they had to ""keep it a hundred"" so they could trust one another.""Cause how could you have a... have a open conversation about some shit that is uhm... federal-time worthy shit and the person... you know... is... half-ass in communication?"" Velentzas said. ""I""m gonna die for your ass and you don't communicate?""Federal authorities apparently have been aware of the women for a number of years. Velentzas ""expressed violent jihadist ideology and an interest in terrorism"" in meetings with the undercover agent back in 2013, and said that being a martyr guarantees entrance into heaven. Siddiqui allegedly wrote a poem in 2009 for a magazine called Jihad Recollections, which was a predecessor to the al-Qaeda publication Inspire, and sent a letter to a man arrested for trying to detonate a bomb during a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon, in 2010.

"In what was an emotional and contentious scene at the Rowan County, Ky., Courthouse this morning, one dramatic legal standoff came to an end when a gay couple was issued a marriage license.James Yates and William Smith, who had tried this five times before, arrived at the courthouse just as the sun started peeking out from under the mountains on the horizon.They walked past protesters — some condemning them and some cheering them — and entered the clerk's office.Kim Davis, the county clerk who had stood in their way those five previous attempts, was in jail. She was held in contempt by a federal judge Thursday for refusing to hand out marriage licenses in defiance of the U.S. Supreme Court. So early Friday, Yates and Smith walked up to Deputy Clerk Brian Mason.Mason was all business. He checked their licenses, asked them if they were related, took their $35 and, in about five minutes, handed them an envelope and said, ""Congratulations.""Yates and Smith had become the first same-sex couple to receive a marriage license from Rowan County.They exited to chants of ""Love has won. Love has won.""""I don't want her in jail,"" Yates said of Davis. ""No one wanted her in jail. We just wanted the licenses given out. This isn't a blessing. It's an official license.""""This means, at least for this area, civil rights are civil rights and they're not subject to beliefs.""Davis' husband, Joe Davis, was also outside the courthouse with a group of protesters who called this a moral fight.""We don't hate these people. That's the furthest thing from our hearts,"" he said. ""We don't hate nobody. We just want to have the same rights that they have. They're saying, 'Hey we're gonna make you accept us.'

"They came close in Iowa, but just fell short of claiming victory. Tuesday night in New Hampshire was a different story.The political outsiders have taken control of this election.Donald Trump won Tuesday night’s Republican primary in New Hampshire. By a margin of 34 percent to 16 percent for John Kasich, Trump proved that his slogan of “Make America Great Again” resonates with voters – in a big way.On the Democratic side, self proclaimed socialist Bernie Sanders edged Hillary Clinton out by 20 percentage points. His message railing against the rigged economy, special interests that control Washington and pledging to give Americans universal healthcare and free college tuition brought together a larger coalition of young voters than the one Barack Obama built in 2008.To my mind, Tuesday night’s results show that there are finally politicians who understand how marginalized, disenfranchised and betrayed a majority of Americans feel. It’s both Republicans and Democrats, including the 42 percent of Americans who now identify as independent because they think the two parties don’t represent their values and positions.We are seeing a full scale rejection of the political establishment. This is a threat that we did not take seriously enough over the past few years, as evidenced by the fact that most rejected Trump as a clown and a joke. His ideas on illegal immigration and placing a temporary ban on Muslims ruffled our national feathers even though a majority of Republican primary voters agreed with him. That’s how out of touch our political class has become.Indeed, 46 percent of GOP voters say they feel betrayed by Republican politicians. Trump won 32 percent of that group.We did the same thing to Bernie Sanders who began this race upwards of 50 points behind Hillary Clinton. We said a socialist could never win. And he may not be able to win a national election, but we are seeing an electorate so starved for an honest and trustworthy politician that they will make allowances for ideologies that they may not have considered before.Sanders has argued about oligarchy and money in politics and has been his whole career. He doesn’t flip flop or evolve on his advocacy for the average American.Sanders is just Bernie Sanders. And Donald Trump is just Donald Trump.We are living in a time when trust in Americans institutions has collapsed. A recent Pew survey shows that less than 20 percent of Americans trust the government always or most of the time. And a CNN poll showed that 60 percent think the American Dream is unachievable today.Against this backdrop, it’s no surprise that America is in revolt. Honesty and trustworthiness matters more than whether a candidate has experience or can win in November according to voters. And the establishment isn’t delivering anything resembling what the American populace desires in their political leaders.I see a clearer path to the nomination for Trump than for Sanders, but there is no doubt that Americans have spoken and they’re done with business as usual.Douglas E.

"Why are Americans expected to die sooner than their peers in other high-income countries?A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association takes a look at the question. The results are, well, not too surprising — three of the big drivers for the year analyzed, 2012, were guns, drugs, and cars.The study looked at these causes of injury deaths, which are the three biggest causes of injury death in the US and altogether account for more than 100,000 early deaths each year in America. It compared how common these deaths are in the US versus other high-income countries — the UK, Denmark, Sweden, Japan, and eight others — with 2012 data from the US National Vital Statistics System and the World Health Organization Mortality Database.It found that, on average, men and women in the other high-income countries can expect to live about 2.2 years longer than men and women in the US — and guns, drugs, and cars played a prominent role.Among men, gun deaths explained 21 percent of the gap, drug overdoses 14 percent, and car crashes 13 percent. And among women, gun deaths explained 4 percent, drug overdoses 9 percent, and car crashes 6 percent.In total, the death rate for guns, drugs, and cars was much, much higher in the US than its developed peers, as this chart shows:""Although the reasons for the gap in life expectancy at birth between the United States and comparable countries are complex,"" study authors Andrew Fenelon, Li-Hui Chen, and Susan Baker wrote, ""a substantial portion of this gap reflects just three causes of injury.""So why do Americans die more from these causes? There are cultural factors, but bad policy plays a role too.With guns, the research shows that America's unusually high levels of gun ownership lead to more gun violence. Other factors, such as socioeconomic issues, contribute to violence, but guns are the one issue that makes America unique relative to other developed countries in comparable socioeconomic circumstances. (To learn more about America's gun problem, read Vox's explainer.)""A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,"" UC Berkeley's Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins wrote in a breakthrough analysis in 1999. ""A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.""Some research also shows tightening existing gun control measures in the US would help: Studies in both Connecticut and Missouri suggested that gun licensing laws in those states helped reduce homicides and suicides.With drugs, America is now in the middle of a harrowing opioid and heroin epidemic that's killing tens of thousands of people each year. (For an in-depth dive on this topic, read Vox's explainer.)Academic analyses of the crisis have concluded that the US was too slow to respond to misleading advertising campaigns from opioid producers, in which they claimed that their drugs were safe and effective. Americans have suffered the consequences, getting addicted to and dying from opioid painkillers and heroin as pharmaceutical companies have massively profited.With cars, by the 1960s European policies began encouraging walking, cycling, and public transportation. The US, meanwhile, continued to encourage sprawl and driving. The result: Americans drive much more than their European peers, and are more likely to die in crashes as a result. (To learn more about US and European transportation policy, read Ralph Buehler's great explainer at the Atlantic's CityLab.)Even perfect policies might not fix all of these problems — Americans, after all, love their guns, drugs, and cars, and that cultural preference will likely remain strong for some time.

"Newly released video captured by an Arizona police officer’s body camera captures the chilling moment when a deranged suspect drew a gun and fired the bullet that killed the officer last month.Rookie Flagstaff Police Officer Tyler Stewart’s camera caught the entire, deadly encounter with Robert Smith, whose girlfriend had called police on Dec. 27 to report he had trashed her apartment. The video, released by the police department in response to Freedom of Information Act requests, begins with Stewart getting out of his squad car and ends with Smith pointing the gun at him and firing.Smith then shot himself dead, and Stewart, who was 24, later died at a hospital.""Officer Stewart was murdered by Smith without any provocation or warning,"" Sgt. Margaret Bentzen told the Arizona Daily Sun. ""There were no homicidal or suicidal indications from Smith prior to the crime.""The frightening, 14-minute video comes as the Justice Department is encouraging police departments around the nation to invest in the body cameras following high-profile cases in which police have been criticized, including last August’s police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.Stewart and Smith speak outside Smith's Flagstaff home on Dec. 27 for about three minutes as Smith stands with his hands in his jacket pockets. When Stewart asks him if he has any weapons on him, Smith replies, “No, sir. I'm just cold,” and says he only has “smokes” in his pocket.Stewart then calmly asks if he can check Smith for weapons. When he reaches toward him, Smith draws a .22-caliber revolver from his right pocket and fires six times at Stewart. Five shots hit Strewart, four in the head and one in the lower back.One of Smith's roommates told police that Smith had been contemplating suicide, according to police reports.Stewart had gone to Smith’s girlfriend’s home earlier, but the man who would later kill him was gone. The cop then went to Smith's home, where his roommate said Smith had fled, according to a police report. Records indicate that about an hour later, at 12.30 p.m., Smith called the Flagstaff Police Department and left a message for Stewart, who then went back to Smith’s home where the fatal encounter took place.“This is an enormous tragedy for our department and the family of our officer,” Flagstaff Police Chief Kevin Treadway told AZ Central. “We are a very close-knit organization, and know that all members of the Flagstaff Police Department are grieving at this time.”Release of the frightening footage raises questions about balancing the public's right to know against privacy concerns of police officers and their families, according to Levi Bolton Jr., executive director of the 14,000-member Arizona Police Association. On Wednesday, Bolton met with state lawmakers to discuss the cameras and how best to handle disclosure of footage that may show innocent bystanders, undercover police or informants or, as in Stewart's case, the final moments of an officer's life.""We are currently crafting or looking at legislation that may very well discuss this,"" Bolton told reporters. ""We acknowledge that the public and the media should have access to this information.""A fund to help Stewart's family has been established and those wishing to donate can do so at any Wells Fargo Bank, according to the Flagstaff Police Department.

"Architect Of Paris Attacks Was Killed In Raid, French Authorities SayThe suspected architect of the Paris attacks was killed during a violent police raid conducted by French authorities in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis on Wednesday, French authorities say.Abdelhamid Abaaoud was a Belgian national in his late 20s. Authorities believe that Abaaoud was close to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi.During a press conference, Minister of the Interior Bernard Cazeneuve said that Abaaoud was believed to be responsible for planning many of the Islamic State attacks in Europe.Of the six planned attacks that have been foiled in France, he said, Abaaoud was believed to have been involved in four of them. Authorities believe he orchestrated the the three teams that attacked six locations across Paris and killed 129 people.Announcing his death, Cazeneuve said that as promised, ""the Republic is doing everything it can to destroy terrorism.""The Saint-Denis raid on Wednesday were bloody and violent. Police fired more than 5,000 rounds and one suspect — presumed to be a woman — detonated a suicide vest. Another suspect, whom we can now assume was Abaaoud, was killed by either gunfire or a grenade explosion during the confrontation with police.Yesterday, authorities said because of the carnage, forensic evidence had to be used to identify the dead. Today, Paris Prosecutor François Molins said that Abaaoud's was identified using fingerprints.As we've reported, until recently authorities believed that Abaaoud was issuing orders from Syria. Cazeneuve said that authorities knew that he had left for Syria in 2014, but they had no indication that he had come back to Europe.However, three days after the Paris attacks on Nov. 16, Cazeneuve said they received a tip from an ""intelligence service outside of Europe,"" saying they had picked up signals that Abaaoud had passed through Greece. Authorities across the world knew, he said, that an international warrant had been issued for Abaaoud's arrest. The implication there is that somehow Abaaoud's presence in Europe had fallen through the cracks.Cazeneuve added that he has called for a meeting with other European countries to talk about ways they can bolster cooperation on border controls and the fight against weapons trafficking.""Things are not going far enough. Things are not moving fast enough,"" Cazeneuve said.

"There were several reports this month, based on former and current aides, that Mitt Romney is actively weighing another presidential run. The biggest sign yet comes from a recent interview with The New York Times, where the former 2012 Republican nominee offered a less than Shermanesque response to the million-dollar question.This was the obvious opening for me to ask if there was a chance. Romney's response was decidedly meta — ""I have nothing to add to the story"" -- but he then fell into the practiced political parlance of nondenial. ""We've got a lot of people looking at the race,"" he said. ""We'll see what happens.""Buoyed by good poll numbers and a wide-open prospective Republican field, Romney went farther than his ""circumstances can change"" reply in August, and certainly miles forward from the, ""Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no,"" answer in January.If he does throw his hat into the ring for a third time, the former governor of Massachusetts told the Times that he would employ a cameraman -- essentially his own tracker -- to follow him around in order to guard against statements that derailed his 2012 campaign. ""I want to be reminded that this is not off the cuff,"" Romney said.Romney said the tactic could potentially prevent another ""47 percent"" incident, which by his telling, was nothing more than a problem of setting.""My mistake was that I was speaking in a way that reflected back to the man,"" Romney said.

"THE STING videos targeting Planned Parenthood are hard to watch. Doctors talk clinically, some say callously, about harvesting fetal tissue. Technicians identify and isolate tiny organs. References are made to “it’s a baby” or “it’s another boy.” The videos were taken surreptitiously and were artfully edited to produce maximum discomfort about complicated issues that, for many, are inherently uncomfortable.That truths were distorted to paint an inaccurate and unfair picture of a health organization that provides valuable services to women — as well as to demonize research that leads to important medical advances — doesn’t matter to antiabortion activists. Or, sadly, to the politicians who pander to them.Planned Parenthood is under virulent attack for the role a small portion of its affiliates play in helping women who want to donate fetal tissue for medical research. The antiabortion group Center for Medical Progress has orchestrated a propaganda campaign accusing the nation’s largest provider of abortions of profiting from the illegal sale of fetal tissue, a charge refuted by Planned Parenthood.None of the videos released shows anything illegal and, in fact, the full footage of Planned Parenthood executives meeting with people presumed to be buyers for a human biologics company include repeated assertions that clinics are not selling tissue but only seeking permitted reimbursement costs for expenses. Indeed, the Colorado clinic featured in the videos refused to enter into a contract with the phony company because of its failure to meet its legal and ethical standards.Such facts, though, haven’t stopped officials in several Republican-led states, including Texas, Louisiana and Ohio, from launching investigations of Planned Parenthood, even though affiliates in those states don’t facilitate fetal tissue donations. In Washington, Senate Republicans have fast-tracked a bid to defund Planned Parenthood, with a vote set for Monday. Fortunately, it’s unlikely there will be 60 votes to advance the bill, as cutting off funds to Planned Parenthood would be irresponsible.No federal money is used by Planned Parenthood to provide abortions except in some rare exceptions. So cutting off government funds, mostly through Medicaid and grants, would only hurt the thousands of people, most of them low-income women, who each day depend upon Planned Parenthood for birth control, cancer screenings, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and other health services. Given that many of the clinics are in medically underserved areas, it’s a myth, as Republicans claim, that other providers can fill the gap. Shutting down clinics would make it harder for many women to obtain birth control — and the last thing either side of the abortion debate should want is an increase in unwanted pregnancies that result in more abortions.We are under no illusions that the vendetta against Planned Parenthood will end. Conservative Republicans are already threatening to shut down the federal government in the fall by blocking any spending that includes money for Planned Parenthood. It’s clear from how quickly Republican presidential hopefuls seized on the issue that it will be a staple of the campaign trail. Consequently, it’s important that congressional Democrats and others continue to stand up for Planned Parenthood and the women whose health depends upon its services.","Translate the text into a visual infographic, summarizing key facts and figures in a graphical format.","****Infographic Summary of Text****Key Facts and Figures:****Planned Parenthood:*** Provides valuable services to women, including birth control, cancer screenings, and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.* Is under virulent attack for the role a small portion of its affiliates play in helping women who want to donate fetal tissue for medical research.* Has not engaged in the illegal sale of fetal tissue.**Fetal Tissue Donation:*** The"

"""2014 was the planet's warmest year on record. Fourteen of the 15 hottest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century,"" Obama said. ""Yes, this winter was cold in parts of our country, including Washington. Some people in Washington helpfully used a snowball to illustrate that fact. But around the world, in the aggregate, it was the warmest winter ever recorded.""It's of course a huge coincidence that the visit is in the backyard of two Republican presidential hopefuls who have been squishy on the subject of climate change, and a Republican governor who reportedly told state employees they can't even use the words ""climate change.""""Climate change can no longer be denied,"" Obama said. ""It can't be edited out. It can't be omitted from the conversation. And action can no longer be delayed.""   Ahead of the visit, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on a call that Obama would ""use the occasion of Earth Day to highlight his commitment to fighting to protect public health and to fighting the carbon pollution that contributes to climate change."" And the president picked Florida, Earnest said, because it's a place ""where these kinds of issues have traditionally been bipartisan.""Earnest was coy about the fact that Florida also happens to be the home of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio, two likely Republican presidential contenders who haven't been as enthusiastic about climate action. Bush has said he's a ""skeptic"" when it comes to climate change, while Rubio says he doesn't believe human activity is causing the planet to heat up.The president, Earnest said on the call, hopes the visit ""will prompt an elevated political debate about making climate change a priority."" However, he added, the trip is ""not an effort to go to anyone's home state, but to raise the debate.""Earnest maintained that Obama's visit ""isn't about campaigns, this is about making progress on a priority."" But he also noted that ""the Republicans who choose to deny the reality of climate change, they do that to the detriment of the people they're elected to represent.""Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), also no big fan of the concept of climate change, has taken to Twitter to criticize Obama's Everglades visit. Scott argued that the president should do more to get federal funding for Everglades restoration, because, he said, ""Our environment is too important to neglect.""Earnest fired back against Scott on Wednesday. ""It's a little tough to take criticism from someone who has banned the words 'climate change' for the accusation that the president has been insufficiently committed to fighting climate change,"" he said, referring to reports that Florida officials were forbidden from using the terms ""global warming"" and ""climate change"" in official communications. ""That's a tough case to make, but it sounds like that didn't stop him.""The White House also used the occasion to tout the benefits of the National Park Service, which will celebrate its 100th anniversary next year. A new report from the NPS released Wednesday finds that every dollar invested in the parks returns $10 to the U.S. economy through tourism and other related industries. The NPS reported a record 293 million visitors in 2014.","Reframe the text as a magic spell or incantation, weaving the story's elements into a mystical formula.","""In the year of the sun's dance, 2014, the planet sang a melody of warmth.

"Former Florida governor and likely GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush offered a defense of conservative Christian principles and attacked the Obama administration for failing to preserve religious freedom during his commencement address at Liberty University, a Christian school in Lynchburg, Virginia.Bush accused the Obama administration of using ""coercive federal power"" to infringe on the religious rights of Americans.""What should be easy calls, in favor of religious freedom, have instead become an aggressive stance against it. Somebody here is being small-minded and intolerant, and it sure isn’t the nuns, ministers, and laymen and women who ask only to live and practice their faith,"" he said, according to remarks released ahead of the speech. ""Federal authorities are demanding obedience, in complete disregard of religious conscience -- and in a free society, the answer is 'no.'”Last year, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Obama administration could not require closely held corporations to provide insurance coverage of contraception to employees if the employers objected on religious grounds.Bush converted to Catholicism -- his wife's religion -- two decades ago following a tense period in his marriage. Bush has said in the past that he believes the faith of leaders should shape their decision-making.""[S]ome moral standards are universal. They do not bend under the weight of cultural differences or elite opinion. Wherever there is a child waiting to be born, we say choose life, and we say it with love,"" Bush said on Saturday. ""Wherever women and girls in other countries are brutally exploited, or treated as possessions without rights and dignity, we Christians see that arrogance for what it is. Wherever Jews are subjected to the oldest bigotry, we reject that sin against our brothers and sisters, and we defend them.""Liberty University was founded by Jerry Falwell, a former Southern Baptist pastor and religious commentator. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced his presidential campaign at the school in March.","Translate the article into a poetic format, capturing the essence and emotions of the story.","With faith and passion, he takes the stage,Defending freedom, turning a page.A champion of Christian principles,He calls out the Obama regime,For infringing on religious rights,And using force to suppress the light.The government's overreach,A threat to faith, a cruel breach,"

Thx for using your speech to advocate for #EqualPay and for understanding that when women succeed, America succeeds — Valerie Jarrett (@vj44) February 23, 2015 Democrats have pushed a bill intended to close the pay gap between men and women by offering new legal protections to women who complain that they're being underpaid relative to their male peers, and by having the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission collect gender and racial pay data. The bill failed to clear the 60-vote procedural threshold in the Senate last year -- and it's all but certain not to advance now that Republicans control both the House and the Senate, leaving Democrats to raise the issue on the presidential campaign trail instead. Republicans argue there are already enough protections on the books to ensure women have the right to equal wages. Clinton's comments come as The New York Times reports she plans to make her gender -- and potential to break the ""glass ceiling"" and become America's first female president -- a central theme in her widely expected 2016 campaign. During her speech Tuesday, Clinton recalled being pregnant while working in an Arkansas law firm that had no maternity leave policy. She also called the tech industry the ""wild west,"" and said it needs to be more welcoming to women. ""As women, let's do more to help all women lead on and succeed,"" she said.

"They came close in Iowa, but just fell short of claiming victory. Tuesday night in New Hampshire was a different story.The political outsiders have taken control of this election.Donald Trump won Tuesday night’s Republican primary in New Hampshire. By a margin of 34 percent to 16 percent for John Kasich, Trump proved that his slogan of “Make America Great Again” resonates with voters – in a big way.On the Democratic side, self proclaimed socialist Bernie Sanders edged Hillary Clinton out by 20 percentage points. His message railing against the rigged economy, special interests that control Washington and pledging to give Americans universal healthcare and free college tuition brought together a larger coalition of young voters than the one Barack Obama built in 2008.To my mind, Tuesday night’s results show that there are finally politicians who understand how marginalized, disenfranchised and betrayed a majority of Americans feel. It’s both Republicans and Democrats, including the 42 percent of Americans who now identify as independent because they think the two parties don’t represent their values and positions.We are seeing a full scale rejection of the political establishment. This is a threat that we did not take seriously enough over the past few years, as evidenced by the fact that most rejected Trump as a clown and a joke. His ideas on illegal immigration and placing a temporary ban on Muslims ruffled our national feathers even though a majority of Republican primary voters agreed with him. That’s how out of touch our political class has become.Indeed, 46 percent of GOP voters say they feel betrayed by Republican politicians. Trump won 32 percent of that group.We did the same thing to Bernie Sanders who began this race upwards of 50 points behind Hillary Clinton. We said a socialist could never win. And he may not be able to win a national election, but we are seeing an electorate so starved for an honest and trustworthy politician that they will make allowances for ideologies that they may not have considered before.Sanders has argued about oligarchy and money in politics and has been his whole career. He doesn’t flip flop or evolve on his advocacy for the average American.Sanders is just Bernie Sanders. And Donald Trump is just Donald Trump.We are living in a time when trust in Americans institutions has collapsed. A recent Pew survey shows that less than 20 percent of Americans trust the government always or most of the time. And a CNN poll showed that 60 percent think the American Dream is unachievable today.Against this backdrop, it’s no surprise that America is in revolt. Honesty and trustworthiness matters more than whether a candidate has experience or can win in November according to voters. And the establishment isn’t delivering anything resembling what the American populace desires in their political leaders.I see a clearer path to the nomination for Trump than for Sanders, but there is no doubt that Americans have spoken and they’re done with business as usual.Douglas E.

"U.S. Flag Flies Over Embassy In Cuba For First Time In 54 YearsUpdated at 11:25 a.m. ETSecretary of State John Kerry presided over a ceremony reopening the U.S. Embassy in Havana, including a flag-raising ceremony — an event that will mark the first time the Stars and Stripes have flown over a diplomatic compound there in 54 years.Kerry, speaking before assembled dignitaries, remembered the strained history of U.S.-Cuba relations, including the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, when the Soviet Union was discovered to be siting nuclear rockets on the island nation.""I was a student then and I could still remember the taut faces of our leaders,"" he said. ""We were unsettled and uncertain about our future because we didn't know when we went to bed what we would find when we woke up.""The people of Cuba ""would be best served by a genuine democracy,"" he said, but added that it was ""unrealistic"" to expect Cuba to make such a transition anytime soon. ""Cuba's future is for Cubans to shape,"" he said.Speaking in Spanish, Kerry said the ceremony showed that the U.S. and Cuba ""are no longer enemies, but neighbors.""Three U.S. Marines who lowered the flag at the embassy in 1961, when Havana and Washington severed diplomatic ties, accompanied Kerry to the ceremony and presented the new flag to Marines to hoist once again to the strains of the Star Spangled Banner.The Washington Post reports that the three Marines, retired Master Gunnery Sgt. Jim Tracy and then-Lance Cpl. Larry C. Morris and then-Cpl. F.W. Mike East, all now in their 70s, ""will appear in Havana alongside Secretary of State John F. Kerry and raise the flag again. It has been more than 54 years since U.S. relations with Cuba were severed, but the embassy has reopened following an agreement reached earlier this year between Havana and Washington.""NPR's Michele Kelemen says: ""The State Department has come under criticism for not inviting leading Cuban dissidents to the embassy. Officials say that's because this is a government-to-government event. Activists are invited to a reception later, at the U.S. ambassador's residence.""And, the Associated Press reports:",Present the information as a series of Instagram-style photo captions.,"**Photo 1:**""Stars and Stripes dance over Havana!

"WASHINGTON — House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday that Senate Democrats should ""get off their ass"" and stop blocking a $40 billion Homeland Security bill that would derail President Obama's immigration programs.Boehner's comments came a day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the Senate has reached a stalemate and ""the next move obviously is up to the House."" Senate Democrats voted three times last week to block the DHS funding bill from moving forward. They object to House-passed provisions that would cut off all funds to carry out Obama's executive orders on immigration.The two Republican leaders seem to be each placing responsibility on the other chamber for what happens next on the funding bill. Unless Congress acts, funding for the Department of Homeland Security will expire on Feb. 27 and the agency will face a partial shutdown.Boehner said the House will not take up a revised bill despite the Senate impasse.""The House has done its job,"" Boehner, R-Ohio, said at a news conference after meeting with House Republicans. ""Why don't you go ask the Senate Democrats when they're going to get off their ass and do something other than to vote 'no'?""Obama announced in November that he would protect about 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation and allow them to work legally in the U.S. His program would help the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens. It also would expand his 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which gives temporary legal status and work permits to undocumented immigrants brought to the USA as children.The House-passed bill would cut off all funding for the 2012 DACA program as well as blocking funds for Obama's latest immigration orders. Senate Democrats say they will only support the DHS funding bill if the immigration provisions are scrapped.""If Congress wants stronger border security and immigration enforcement, a clean funding bill for DHS is what we should be rallying around,"" said Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., the senior Democrat on the Senate homeland security committee. ""I hope that Congress can come together to do the right thing — support the passage of a clean, full-year appropriation for the Department of Homeland Security by Feb. 27 — and then get to work to pass a thoughtful, comprehensive immigration reform bill.""Republicans see Obama's immigration orders as an unconstitutional power grab and view the DHS funding bill as the best leverage they have to stop them. But Senate Republicans, who have a 54-vote majority, need 60 votes to advance the DHS funding bill and they have been unable to attract any Democrats to their side.Boehner and McConnell have both said they don't want a shutdown of Homeland Security, but their options are running out.There has been talk in both chambers of the possibility of passing a continuing resolution that would keep DHS open and funded at 2014 levels. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has spoken out against that option because it would not allow DHS to hire new Secret Service agents, buy new surveillance equipment for the Southwest border or send certain security grants to states and local governments.",Format as a quiz to test readers' understanding and opinions on the topic.,**Key points:*** The bill would cut off all funds for Obama's latest immigration orders and the 2012 DACA program.* Senate Democrats say they will only support the bill if the immigration provisions are scrapped.* Republicans see Obama's immigration orders as an unconstitutional power
"LAS VEGAS  The Democratic presidential candidates are holding their first debate Tuesday night in Las Vegas.It marks the first time frontrunner Hillary Clinton and her main challenger so far  socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.  will appear on the same stage in this campaign, along with the other three candidates.This campaign was expected to be a cakewalk for the former first lady, but it hasn't turned out that way.One big reason seems to be the story that just won't away: how she used a private email server to conduct government business. It's fed a perception that she can play by a different set of rules.Even so, Clinton still has a decent lead nationally over the socialist senator from Vermont, but Sanders is coming on strong. He's beating her comfortably in the key state of New Hampshire and is close in Iowa, too.Plus, Sanders is the one drawing tens of thousands of people to his events. Democratic voters seem to be listening intently to his populist messages.With the threat from Sanders a reality, Clinton is now trying to reposition herself a little more leftward. Just recently she came out against President Barack Obama's big Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement.That's a reversal because while serving as secretary of state, she was for it. This new position puts her more in line with the liberal base of her party.""As of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it,"" Clinton said. ""I don't believe it's going to meet the high bar I have set.""So, tonight the drama will center on how much Sen. Sanders and the other Democrats confront Clinton directly on the debate stage.Expect former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley to be an instigator. He's trying to get traction and has taken some shots at Clinton over the last few months.As for Clinton herself, she's trying to avoid a repeat of 2008 when she went in as the heavy favorite, then ran into a buzz saw called Barack Obama.This time around the buzz is growing for Bernie Sanders.","Transform into an advice column response, using the article's situation as the query.","The Democratic presidential race is shaping up to be a close one, with frontrunner Hillary Clinton facing a strong challenge from Senator Bernie Sanders.

"Not all the claims in the vice presidential debate stand up to scrutiny. A look at some of them and how they compare with the facts:REPUBLICAN MIKE PENCE: ""The fact that under this past administration, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious.... Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same.""THE FACTS: As a share of the total U.S. economy, the national debt has gone up 35 percent; not a doubling.Still, the debt has ballooned to $19.6 trillion. This largely reflected efforts by the Obama administration to stop the Great Recession.Would Clinton similarly increase the debt? Not according to an analysis by the independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.The Clinton plan with its tax increases would increase the gross debt -- both privately and publicly held-- by $450 billion over 10 years. Mind you, that is on top of an $8.8 trillion increase already projected by the government under current law.As for Donald Trump, the committee says his tax-cut-heavy plan would increase the gross debt by $4.3 trillion --nearly 10 times more than Clinton's plan would do.DEMOCRAT TIM KAINE, on fighting the Islamic State: ""Donald Trump doesn't have a plan.""THE FACTS: Clinton also doesn't have a plan that is materially different than what President Barack Obama is already doing.She's described a three-part strategy that involves crushing IS ""on its home turf"" in the Middle East, disrupting its infrastructure on the ground and online, and protecting America and its allies. All are current elements of the Obama administration's strategy, so it's not clear what would change or if she would accelerate any portions of it.It's also the case that Trump has not laid out a clear plan.PENCE, calling Clinton the ""architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy,"" says the crisis in Syria was the result of a ""failed and weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead.""THE FACTS: Clinton, as secretary of state, actually pushed for increased U.S. intervention after Syrian President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons against rebels. But Obama is the commander in chief and nothing has swayed him thus far. Whatever her failings might be on foreign policy, it's a stretch to accuse her of helping to lead a weak policy on Syria.PENCE: ""We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal.""THE FACTS: The coal industry's woes don't come solely from onerous federal regulations. Pence omitted the effects of steep competition from cheap natural gas.A string of major coal companies have filed for bankruptcy in recent years, including Arch Coal, Alpha Natural Resources and Peabody Energy. Layoffs and cutbacks have spread economic suffering through coal country in the Appalachians and Wyoming's Powder River Basin. By contrast, these are boom times for natural gas extraction, mostly due to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.Still, the Obama administration has implemented rules that aren't making the coal industry's life any easier. Obama last year imposed a rule requiring coal-fired power plants to cut their carbon emissions as part of his effort to combat climate change. The rule has been suspended pending a legal challenge. Obama also has halted new coal leases on federal lands until it completes a comprehensive review.PENCE, saying he's proud that ""the state of Indiana has balanced budgets.""THE FACTS: True, but that's not exactly to his credit as governor of Indiana. A balanced budget is required by law, as it is in every state except Vermont.",Formulate as an inspiring speech for high school students.,"The vice presidential debate showcased a stark contrast in economic and foreign policy perspectives between the Republican and Democratic parties. While some claims made by both candidates may not hold up to scrutiny, it is important to examine the facts and analyze the potential impact of their proposed policies.Republican Mike Pence criticized the Obama administration's handling of the national debt and blamed Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine for its current state. However, the facts reveal that the debt has increased by 35"
"Former Florida governor and likely GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush offered a defense of conservative Christian principles and attacked the Obama administration for failing to preserve religious freedom during his commencement address at Liberty University, a Christian school in Lynchburg, Virginia.Bush accused the Obama administration of using ""coercive federal power"" to infringe on the religious rights of Americans.""What should be easy calls, in favor of religious freedom, have instead become an aggressive stance against it. Somebody here is being small-minded and intolerant, and it sure isn’t the nuns, ministers, and laymen and women who ask only to live and practice their faith,"" he said, according to remarks released ahead of the speech. ""Federal authorities are demanding obedience, in complete disregard of religious conscience -- and in a free society, the answer is 'no.'”Last year, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Obama administration could not require closely held corporations to provide insurance coverage of contraception to employees if the employers objected on religious grounds.Bush converted to Catholicism -- his wife's religion -- two decades ago following a tense period in his marriage. Bush has said in the past that he believes the faith of leaders should shape their decision-making.""[S]ome moral standards are universal. They do not bend under the weight of cultural differences or elite opinion. Wherever there is a child waiting to be born, we say choose life, and we say it with love,"" Bush said on Saturday. ""Wherever women and girls in other countries are brutally exploited, or treated as possessions without rights and dignity, we Christians see that arrogance for what it is.

"After floating a series of ridiculous Vice Presidential picks, Carson was axed from Trump’s selection team, sources close to the campaign told The Daily Beast.Ben Carson has the ability to say everything he shouldn’t at exactly the wrong time.Since the former neurosurgeon has taken up the role of working on Donald Trump’s vice presidential team, he has suggested that the candidate may pick a Democratic running mate, dropped she-who-must-not-be-named Sarah Palin as a potential pick and earlier generally questioned a number of the presumptive nominee’s habits from his Twitter use to lack of pragmatism.Last week, Armstrong Williams (his business manager and close confidant), told The Daily Beast that Carson left the team of his own volition. Carson had bigger and more important things to do, according to Williams, like preparing Trump for his meeting with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.But three sources close to the Trump campaign said Carson didn’t leave on his own. He was pushed.According to sources close to Trump’s campaign, Carson was demoted after Trump specifically wanted him to head up the VP selection team. He submitted names that he thought would be valuable picks and inevitably lost his top spot days later. Carson allegedly called Trump afterwards and was angry that the situation played out like this.In the absence of a person to head up the operation, embattled campaign manager Corey Lewandowski stepped in and took over the spot, as first reported by The Washington Post. The Daily Beast has confirmed that Lewandowski is still in charge of the process.The list of names Carson later provided to The Washington Post—which included Palin, Marco Rubio, and John Kasich—was apparently just taken from various conversations within the campaign and is in no way confirmed. One source claimed that Carson mentioned the list in order to get retaliation for Lewandowski taking his position.“Well that’s part of what Lewandowski would want you to believe but there’s no truth to that,” Williams said of the takeover.When asked about any possible rocky relationship with Barry Bennett, now a Trump adviser and Carson’s former campaign manager, Williams said there were no issues there either.And Williams doesn’t either, not since December at least when Bennett exited the campaign after internal disagreements with the business manager who he claimed was causing issues with the struggling presidential bid.Despite multiple people familiar with the matter confirming that a conversation took place to demote Carson, Williams asserted that the relationship between the real estate mogul and the doctor was going swimmingly.“Dr. Carson and Mr. Trump have a wonderful understanding,” Williams said. “Sometimes I along with Trump’s top people are not always aware of what they are strategizing. [Carson] doesn’t always share with me. That’s a good thing.”Williams has not always been an entirely reliable source of information about the goings-on inside the Trump campaign however. When he told The Daily Beast that Carson was off the VP team, a Trump campaign source told CNN that he had “fucked it up.”","Rewrite the text as a wedding vow, romantically linking the themes or messages of the story.","My beloved, I stand before you today with a heart filled with love and gratitude for the journey we have shared.

"Ben Carson has seized the national lead from Donald Trump in a new poll, in a development sure to force the billionaire businessman to modify his well-polished campaign stump boast that he's ""leading every poll.""Released ahead of Wednesday's third Republican presidential primary debate, the CBS News/New York Times Poll showed Carson leading nationally with 26 percent, to Trump's 22 percent.The survey follows a string of Iowa polls that showed the retired neurosurgeon pulling ahead in the first-in-the-nation caucus state. Trump, who had led the field nationally and in key states since the summer, has tried to downplay the results but on Tuesday acknowledged Carson is gaining momentum.""Ben Carson is now doing well,"" Trump said in an interview Tuesday morning on MSNBC.At the same time, Trump has made clear he plans to challenge Carson at Wednesday's primary debate as the two battle for the top spot.Trump previously called Carson ""low energy"" and questioned his immigration stance.

"As the Democratic presidential contest reaches the third state, what began as a coronation is now an exciting dead heat. Yet by one measure, Bernie Sanders is ­already a clear winner.Regardless of whether the senator from Vermont captures the actual nomination, he has won the future of the Democratic Party.Sanders is demolishing the last remnants of the old order, as represented by Hillary Clinton and her split-the-difference triangulation. It is Sanders, not she, who is the true heir of the radical politics of Barack Obama.Calling a paradigm shift is like forecasting a recession — predict it often enough and you’ll eventually be right. Yet the developments unfolding before our eyes suggest the Democratic Party is undergoing a massive change. And a 74-year-old socialist is the architect.A major piece of evidence is the enormous youth vote he attracts. In Iowa and New Hampshire, he beat Clinton by about 70 points — 84 percent to 15 percent — among voters under age 30. And despite the nasty demands by Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem that women must support Clinton, Sanders got 82 percent of the young female vote.By contrast, Obama in the 2008 primaries typically beat Clinton among young people by about 20 points.

"In some gas stations around the country, the price of a gallon of regular has dropped below $1.42. AAA and GasBuddy, two organizations that follow gasoline prices, say that gasoline prices below $2 will not be unusual in most of the United States. As oil prices fall, and refinery capacity stays strong, the price of gas could reach $1 a gallon in some areas, a level last reached in 1999. As a matter of fact, the entire states of Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Caroline have gas prices that average at or below $1.75.Gasoline prices are driven mostly by four factors: oil prices, proximity to refineries, refinery capacity and state taxes and levies. Oil prices have dropped below $33 a barrel and continue to collapse. The recent decision by Saudi Arabia to continue to keep its oil exports high essentially has dissolved the OPEC cartel. The decision also has forced the kingdom to chop its 2016 budget. This ongoing supply glut guarantees oversupply of crude. At the same time, slowing national economies in the largest countries, including China, will lower demand. China now tops the list of oil importers, according to the Financial Times, having moved ahead of the United States.The cost of producing oil from shale deposits, particularly in the United States, is greater in some cases than what it can be sold for. Nonetheless, parts of this industry continue pumping, increasing supply, while others go bankrupt because they cannot survive with crude prices so low.Several states house large refineries or are close to those that do. This is particularly the case near the Gulf of Mexico, including the massive refinery operations south of Houston. Some owned by Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) process several hundreds of thousands of barrels per day. Proximity to refineries is a factor in gasoline prices, if the refineries are running at or near capacity and produce gasoline instead of other petroleum products.Finally, gas taxes in several states are well below the national average of $0.4869 a gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. In some low gas price states, these taxes are below $0.40. This includes South Carolina at $0.3515, Missouri at $0.3570 and Oklahoma at $0.3540. Low gas taxes in these states compound the effect of falling oil prices.The odds grow each day that gas prices will be $1 a gallon in some areas in the United States, particularly those where prices are already close to hitting $1.40 — and falling.24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

"Mel Robbins is a CNN commentator, legal analyst, best-selling author and keynote speaker. In 2014, she was named outstanding news talk-radio host by the Gracie Awards. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author(CNN) If you understand nothing else about Donald Trump, understand this:He has a particular mindset we see all the time in business -- he's ""the disrupter.""The disrupter is someone whose entire ""brand"" is to break the mold, to turn the way we do things on its head. Amazon did this with retail, Uber did it with taxi services, Airbnb did it with travel, Tinder did it with dating, Slack is doing it with email, Spotify is doing it with music, peer-to-peer lending is changing banking.Disrupters don't fix what's broken because they don't innovate from inside the system. They break the mold, change our thinking about the mold and then hand us the new rules for how things work.Just look at the Big Five companies that drive the Internet economy -- all disrupters -- Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook. They were early movers, they played by their own rules. First they disrupted how we do business online, and now they define it. And they control it. Apple just reported its highest earnings ever. Looks like disruption is working.Today every taxi company in America could band together, and they still would not stop the power of Uber. That is because when you gain enough momentum, you dominate the market and the conversation.In his effect on everything from Fox News to the Koch Brothers to the newspapers that endorse candidates, Trump has disrupted every single aspect of the game of politics and created new rules -- and based on the polls, what he's done is working.And so far, most of the political establishment has been wrong about what this all means. They said he wouldn't last and now he's leading in the polls. They said he wouldn't disclose his financial information or quit reality TV and he did both. They said that every insulting, ridiculous, inaccurate and offensive thing that Trump has said would hurt him. No sign of this. They said no network would bow to his demands for shorter debates -- but they did.Who knows what will happen when the Republican National Committee has to officially pick its candidate for president, but -- holy cow -- it sure will be interesting to watch. And who will we be watching? Trump.We can call Trump the carnival barker or the political side show, but discrediting the one who is wielding new power is what we do when we lose control of the negotiation. It's not politics, it's business -- as usual. This is why Trump understands that he can ignore it.He also understands something powerful: leverage. He is above Fox News, because he IS the news. And he knows that what he says AND where he goes is the story and therefore it is the business asset. So he is keeping control of that asset.The establishment can't play by the disrupter's rules, because the rules are designed to destroy it.The Republican establishment has already lost. Trump will be the party's next nominee no matter how many times he says he won't call Megyn Kelly a bimbo. It doesn't matter how many backroom meetings the Koch brothers organize or what Reince Priebus does to rally RNC delegates. It's over.The newspaper endorsements are also irrelevant, as are the fringe politicians and reality stars who are lining up to endorse Trump. They are all too late.The only thing that can beat Donald Trump now is the one thing he doesn't control: Americans who don't want his services as president of the United States.And the only way they will make a difference if there are enough of them -- enough liberals, Democrats, independents, and yes, even some Republicans and conservatives -- who can appreciate the appeal of a disrupter, but don't want one to lead the country.","Convert the article into a comedy sketch, finding humor in the situations or characters involved.","Mel Robbins, a legal analyst and CNN commentator, is known for her bold and often controversial takes on the world of politics and business.

"The poll, conducted from Monday to Friday, showed Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, with a 10.7 point lead among likely voters over Trump, her likely Republican rival in the November presidential election. That's down from a lead of 14.3 points for Clinton on Sunday, the day an American-born shooter who declared allegiance to militant group Islamic State killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.Trump seized on the attack to sharpen his security proposals, saying he would block immigration to the United States from any country with a ""proven history of terrorism"" against America and its allies if elected. The pledge fine-tuned an earlier vow, made after the attacks last year in Paris and California, to ban the entry of all Muslims into the United States.He also called for measures to make it more difficult for suspected terrorists to obtain firearms, veering from the Republican Party's general opposition to gun control.While Trump's comments on both Muslims and guns dismayed some Republican elites, they may have cheered some voters.Some 45 percent of Americans said they supported Trump's idea to suspend Muslim immigration, up from 41.9 percent at the start of the month, according to the poll. Meanwhile, about 70 percent of Americans, including a majority of Democrats and Republicans, said they wanted to see at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns, up from 60 percent in similar polls in 2013 and 2014.Clinton focused her response to the Orlando attack on the need to boost intelligence gathering and defeat Islamic State and what she called ""radical jihadist terrorism,"" while warning against demonizing Muslim-Americans. She also repeated her calls for tougher gun control measures, including a ban on assault weapons.As usual after a major attack, ""terrorism"" jumped to the top concern among all adults in the poll - rising above the economy, health care and other major issues.The poll's five-day average showed that 45.5 percent of likely American voters supported Clinton, while 34.8 percent supported Trump, and another 19.7 percent did not support either candidate. On Sunday, Clinton's support was at 46.6 percent, versus Trump's 32.3 percent.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English with adults living in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii.

"Trump Doubles Down On McCain Criticism, Refusing To ApologizeVeterans groups have added to the chorus of condemnation against Donald Trump — much of it coming from within his own party — following disparaging remarks the real-estate mogul and Republican presidential candidate made about Sen. John McCain's war record.And Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America:As we reported previously, Trump, attending a Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa, on Saturday, lashed out at the Arizona Republican and former GOP presidential nominee, who spent more than five years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam after being shot down in 1967.""He was a war hero because he was captured,"" Trump said. ""I like people who weren't captured.""Fellow candidates, including former Govs. Jeb Bush and Rick Perry and Sen.

""I believe that I will do far more for veterans than John McCain has done for many, many years, with all talk, no action. ...

"Dragging on for an excruciating eternity, this election season has demeaned democracy, elevated mediocrity and insulted and embarrassed us all on just about every level imaginable: Intellectually, with regard to the lack of focus on policy and substance; ethically, with a complete disregard for integrity and character; and morally, driven by a disgraceful descent into racist and xenophobic vitriol.Given that our country has consistently climbed down the educational attainment ladder, and that inane and banal reality TV shows draw more eyeballs than books and opera , it should not surprise us that a growing swath of the electorate is more enthused by a coarse, bullying celebrity than by an awkward policy wonk.But what's doubly disappointing -- as we head into the crucial presidential debates -- is that this lack of intellectual depth is enabled not only by the candidates, but also by the topics they gravitate to, which the media frenzy then exacerbates.These are topics that don't matter when it comes to making a difference in the future of our country: the size of a candidate's hands (and therefore other body parts), the now-moot birther issue, the Monica Lewinsky and Marla Maples scandals, the name-calling and finger pointing about who is more racist than whom, who is healthier than whom.","Rewrite the text as a warranty card, humorously guaranteeing the outcomes or solutions proposed.","This election season has been a real drag, folks.

"Jindal, the Republican governor of Louisiana, referred to Obama's comments as a ""history lesson"" that ignores ""the issue right in front of his nose.""""We will be happy to keep an eye out for runaway Christians, but it would be nice if he would face the reality of the situation today,"" Jindal said in a statement out Friday. ""The Medieval Christian threat is under control, Mr. President. Please deal with the Radical Islamic threat today.""Santorum, who ran for president in 2012 as well, rebuked Obama for ignoring the threat of ISIS and criticizing people of faith.""Today's remarks by the President were inappropriate and his choice of venue was insulting to every person of faith at a time when Christians are being crucified, beheaded, and persecuted across the Middle East,"" the former Pennsylvania senator said in a statement.The comments, which were intended to illustrate the potential for religion to be used for both good and bad aims, drew fierce criticism from conservatives on Thursday. And with Santorum's decision to weigh in, could rapidly become fodder for attacks from potential 2016 contenders looking to burnish their credentials with the religious right. Santorum went on to slam Obama for misunderstanding the threat posed by the rise of Islamic extremism, and accused him of tying modern Christians to ""the scourge in the Middle East."" ""While Christians of today are taught to live their lives as the reflection of Christ's love, the radicals of ISIS use their holy texts as a rationale for violence,"" he said. ""To insinuate modern Christians — the same Christian faith that led the abolitionist movement, the Civil Rights Movement, and global charitable efforts fighting disease and poverty — cannot stand up against the scourge we see in the Middle East is wrong."" Santorum also suggested that some Muslims have only been opposed to ISIS' burning a Jordanian pilot alive because they are opposed to the ""tactic,"" not the actual murder itself. ""Some Muslims...[have] sat quietly by as the Islamic State uses brutal violence that is not antithetical to Islam and only objects on tactics,"" he said. During the National Prayer Breakfast, Obama didn't downplay the threat posed by ISIS, but instead made the case that ""humanity has been grappling with"" the tension between the good and bad deeds done in the name of religion for ages. ""And lest we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place, remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ,"" he said. ""In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ. Michelle and I returned from India — an incredible, beautiful country, full of magnificent diversity — but a place where, in past years, religious faiths of all types have, on occasion, been targeted by other peoples of faith, simply due to their heritage and their beliefs — acts of intolerance that would have shocked Gandhiji, the person who helped to liberate that nation."" But conservatives decried his comments as both further evidence of his poor grasp of the threats facing the nation, and insulting to Christians. Talk-radio host Rush Limbaugh said he insulted ""the whole gamut of Christians,"" and Jim Gilmore, the former GOP governor of Virginia, called the comments ""the most offensive I've ever heard a president make in my lifetime,"" according to the New York Times And Catholic League President Bill Donohue — a frequent critic of Obama — called the comments ""insulting"" and ""pernicious"" in a statement, and said Obama was trying to ""deflect guilt from Muslim madmen.""","Reframe the article as a personal narrative, sharing a personal connection or reflection on the events.","It was a day when the world felt a little less safe, a day when the potential for violence loomed large.

"Under new overtime rules, employees will be injured as well.The Labor Department’s change to the overtime rule is a harsh blow to millions of small businesses and their employees. According to NFIB research, approximately 44% of small businesses would be affected. The department claims that 4.2 million workers could potentially benefit from the change. That’s not consistent with the department’s own analysis.In fact, buried within the regulation, the department projects that many workers won’t receive any additional pay and that others will lose pay. According to Labor, 60% of the newly eligible employees don’t work overtime right now. The department also estimates that the average hourly pay rate will decline in 2017. The talking points say this is a raise for workers, but the economic analysis says something completely different.Most small businesses have razor-thin margins, and they cannot simply raise prices to cover higher costs without losing customers. Moreover, the median personal income for small business owners is roughly $68,000 annually, according to NFIB research. Big corporations can trim shareholder dividends, cut CEO pay or move production facilities out of the country. Those aren’t options for most small firms.Employees will be injured as well. Managers who haven’t punched a clock in years will have to go back to filling out a time sheet. They will even have to take into account work from home such as checking email or fielding a phone call. Essentially, they’ll be demoted from their management positions to hourly jobs.The overtime rule is another government mandate that makes it costlier and more difficult to run a business and create jobs. NFIB surveys its members every month to identify their top concerns. Government regulations consistently rank at the top.Every minute that business owners must devote to keeping records, filling out paperwork and dealing with government inspectors is a minute they don’t have to run their businesses.

"He's combative. He rejects compromise as ""the mushy middle."" He's not inclined to wait his turn. And he doesn't seem to mind annoying his Republican elders with tactics that critics see as destructive and short-sighted.So perhaps it's no surprise that little more than two years after he was sworn in to the Senate, the 44-year-old Texan on Monday became the first contender to officially announce his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. He skipped the one-step-at-a-time tradition of announcing an ""exploratory"" committee to declare flatly that he was in the race.""It's going to take a new generation of courageous conservatives to help make America great again,"" Cruz said in a 30-second video he posted on Twitter early Monday morning, followed by a speech at Liberty University, ""and I'm ready to stand with you to lead the fight.""He won't be lonely for long. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is slated to announce his candidacy in two weeks, likely followed in short order by yet another Republican senator, Marco Rubio of Florida. That's not to mention the governors (Wisconsin's Scott Walker, New Jersey's Chris Christie, Louisiana's Bobby Jindal), the former governors (Florida's Jeb Bush, Texas' Rick Perry, Arkansas' Mike Huckabee), the former senators (Pennsylvania's Rick Santorum) and the others who already are visiting Iowa and New Hampshire and hiring staffers for nascent campaigns.At his speech, a handful of students in a prominent front row sported red ""Stand With Rand"" sweatshirts.Cruz has been overshadowed in recent months by Bush, Walker and other contenders who have more muscular fundraising networks and stronger institutional support. In the Senate, he has been more of an agitator than a legislator. Arizona Sen. John McCain, the GOP's 2008 nominee, once called him a ""wacko bird.""That said, Cruz is worth watching.For one thing, the skills he honed as a college debater at Princeton — he was named U.S. National Speaker of the Year in 1992 — should serve him well in the series of crowded primary debates.For another, while his Tea Party credentials might be a mixed blessing in a general election, in the primaries they align him with the most energized forces in the Republican grass roots today. That helped him upset the establishment's favorite, lieutenant governor David Dewhurst, for the Republican Senate nomination in 2012.What's more, the locale Cruz chose to make Monday's announcement reflects his efforts to broaden his electoral base by wooing Christian conservatives, another key group in the GOP coalition. He spoke at the Lynchburg, Va., school founded by evangelical leader Jerry Falwell that describes itself on its website as the largest Christian university in the world.His speech had the ring of the religious testimony of an evangelical church. He declared his opposition to abortion and his support of traditional marriage. He emotionally described how his father's embrace of Jesus saved his parents' marriage. His father, Rafael, a pastor at a suburban Dallas church, fled Castro's Cuba in 1957.Cruz's Cuban-American heritage would be a selling point for the Republican Party as it tries to reach out to Hispanic voters, although his hardline stance on immigration could be a complication with those voters. And speaking of biography, he has an education that might surprise those inclined to dismiss him: He was graduated from Princeton and then from Harvard Law School, magna cum laude, before clerking at the Supreme Court for Chief Justice William Rehnquist.At one point, he urged his audience to ""take out your cellphones"" and text the word ""Constitution"" or ""Liberty"" — ""we're flexible,"" he said — to a number linked to his campaign.","Write as an interactive web story, where readers choose how to explore the topic.",It also mentions some of his potential strengths and weaknesses.**You can choose to explore the following topics:**1. **Cruz's campaign strategy:** How does he plan to win the Republican nomination and the general election?2. **Cruz's appeal to Christian conservatives:** What are some of the reasons why Christian conservatives might support Cruz?3. **Cruz

"Say what you will about Donald Trump, but the man is winner. Trump didn’t just wallop his opponents Tuesday — he crushed them. Up 41 percent in Delaware, 40 percent in Rhode Island, 37 percent in Pennsylvania, 33 percent in Maryland, 30 percent in Connecticut, he’s estimated to have won 110 delegates, versus five for Kasich and three for Cruz.If the race for the GOP nomination were a Little League game, the mercy rule would be imposed.Here’s where we stand today. Ted Cruz is mathematically eliminated from winning the Republican nomination before the convention in Cleveland. John Kasich has now won a single state — Ohio — where he is governor. If ever there were a series of states that would at least theoretically be fertile territory for him, it would be the Northeast, home of the last vestiges of Republican moderates. Yet, he didn’t crack 30 percent anywhere. Republicans can talk all they want about Never Trump and trying to stop him at the RNC in Cleveland. They can talk about changing the rules and holding out hope that a white knight candidate will emerge. It isn’t going to happen. Either Trump is the nominee or he’ll burn the whole thing to the ground. If you’re a gambler, go all in on the former.It is worth stepping back, however, and noting that Trump’s hammerlock over the party — and his ascendancy within the GOP — is astounding. He’s a political amateur who never held elected office; he’s a xenophobe, a bully, and a misogynist and he has run directly against the leadership of the party he hopes to lead. Yet, today he stands on the cusp of winning the nomination of the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Nixon, and Reagan. I know we’ve all become inured to Trump’s insults, his know-nothingness, and his crudeness, but it can’t be said enough — truly we are living in a political moment unlike anything that any of us has seen before.Here’s what might be even more amazing: Trump’s position as the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party is not the most remarkable political event this year. Rather, it’s that the Democratic Party is poised to nominate the first woman to be a major party candidate for president. Somehow this constantly seems to be forgotten; and whether you like Hillary Clinton or despise her, that America is poised to nominate a woman for president is a big deal.Tuesday night, Clinton racked up four more primary wins, including the delegate-rich states of Maryland and Pennsylvania. Only in Rhode Island did Bernie Sanders thwart her. Early on in the evening, before all the races had been called, he gave a “victory” speech in West Virginia that not only left unmentioned the evening’s results, but plowed forward with confidence about the road ahead. It’s a fitting metaphor for the Sanders campaign, which increasingly seems to operate in a realm completely divorced from reality. Sanders cannot and will not win the Democratic nomination. Period.Indeed, in her victory speech, Clinton — as she has increasingly done — simply ignored Sanders. Instead she aimed her daggers at her real target, Donald Trump. The Democratic race will continue, but for all intents and purposes, it is over. Clinton can now begin her pivot to the general election, and Sanders can play out the string.What we now with some certainty is that we’re only a few months away from an historic, unprecedented presidential campaign — and no matter which candidate wins on Election Day, history will be made.","Translate the article into a poetic format, capturing the essence and emotions of the story.","The political stage ignites, a dance of might,With Trump's force, shining in the light.He wallops his opponents, a sight to see,In states like Delaware, a victory for him.The race for the GOP nomination, a game of might,Cruz and Kasich fade into the night.Trump's hammerlock, a sight to behold,A political amateur, yet a force to be told."
"You've probably seen this chart.It uses analysis from VoteView to show how the House has grown more polarized over time. Democrats in the House have become more liberal; Republicans have become much more conservative.You may also have seen this chart -- but if you haven't, you probably at least are familiar with the concept.It shows the ranges of weekly approval ratings for President Obama over the course of his administration. In other words, each time 82 percent of Democrats approve of Obama, the 82 percent bar gets a little higher. For the most part, opinions of Obama haven't changed much among Democrats or Republicans; his overall approval rating is usually a function of how independents feel about him.Obama isn't the first president to see such polarization in his approval ratings. The first president to do so was the guy before him, George W. Bush. Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton each had some polarization in their second terms, but it wasn't nearly as wide a gap.Which leads us to a natural question: How does the polarization of Congress -- which is a measure of the behavior of members of Congress -- compare with the polarization of approval of the president, a measure of public opinion?That's a question we can answer.Over time, the gap between the political leaning of Republican and Democratic caucuses on Capitol Hill has widened steadily (though not continuously). This compares DW-NOMINATE scores from VoteView, which is a measure of how liberal or conservative each member of Congress is against a baseline. The figures below essentially measure the distance between the two lines in the first graph above.Over that same period, opinions of the president have similarly widened -- again, with some fits and starts.There are two lines here, one using the first Gallup approval rating of the new year and the other averaging the ratings over the year. You can see how attitudes shift; the gap plummets as a president becomes equally popular or unpopular with each party.Anyway, this suggests that as Congress has gotten more polarized, so too have opinions of the presidents.But there's a clearer way to look at this. Plotting the gap in how Democrats and Republicans look at the president on one axis and the gap between the two parties in Congress on the other, you can see clearly how both the former and latter have grown more extreme. (The higher and further to the right a dot, the greater the polarization.)In other words, this polarization isn't only a function of Congress and gerrymandering. There's been a broader polarization that's taken place, reflected in how each party views the president.What it doesn't tell us is the cause. As complicated as these data are, this was the easier part of the analysis.","Transform the text into a trivia quiz, testing knowledge on facts or details mentioned in the story.",****Trivia Quiz:**1.

"WASHINGTON -- Leaders from more than 70 cities and counties, some going against their states, joined a legal brief filed Monday asking an appeals court to allow President Barack Obama's deportation relief policies to move forward.""Continuing to delay implementation of the president’s executive action on immigration hurts our economy and puts families at risk,"" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), who spearheaded the effort with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) as part of Cities United for Immigration Action, said in a statement.""Cities are where immigrants live, and cities are where the president's executive action will be successfully implemented,"" he continued. ""Our cities are united, and we will fight for the immigration reform this nation needs and deserves -- whether in the courtroom, in Congress, or in our communities. Make no mistake about it: our voices will be heard.""Under the policies Obama announced in November, as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants with longstanding ties to the U.S. may be able to stay and work temporarily.Twenty-six states, led by Texas, filed the lawsuit, arguing the relief programs would cause them harm and violate the Constitution. They've won support from some Republican members of Congress and governors.But 14 states and the District of Columbia, including some led by Republicans, filed an amicus brief, saying the programs should be allowed to move forward.Garcetti and de Blasio spearheaded a similar brief in January and received about 30 signatures. The latest brief is backed by mayors, county executives and governments from 73 cities and counties in 27 states. The National League of Cities and the U.S. Conference of Mayors also have joined the brief. The cities and counties are home to 43 million people, according to organizers of the brief.Some cities signing onto the brief are in states that joined the lawsuit against the president's executive actions. Houston, the most populous city in Texas, is part of the cities' and counties' brief, as is the state capital, Austin. Cities and counties in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Arizona, Ohio, Indiana, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Florida and Utah also signed on, even though their states are suing over the executive actions.The brief argues the executive actions would be good for public safety and the economy in their cities and counties, and would help immigrants integrate and keep families together. The delay in implementing Obama's orders, the brief argues, ""harms their cities and counties and all residents thereof by forestalling the critical benefits of that action.""The Obama administration is seeking a ruling to allow the programs to move forward. The Justice Department filed an appeal last week asking the court to lift the injunction.UPDATE: 3:45 p.m. -- Nearly every House Democrat -- 181 of them -- signed on to another amicus brief filed on Monday asking the appeals court to lift the preliminary injunction on Obama's immigration policies.The House Democrats' amicus brief says that they ""well understand the importance of ensuring that the executive does not exceed its constitutional or statutory authority."" But it goes on to say that the lawmakers understand the executive has the authority to use its discretion in enforcing the law.""The broad discretionary authority to set removal policies and priorities is both explicit and implicit in the Nation’s immigration laws and has been exercised also by prior Administrations of both parties in ways consistent with the Secretary’s actions,"" the brief states, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson.",Rewrite the text from the perspective of an inanimate object or animal mentioned in the story.,"As a city resident, I have witnessed the impact of the ongoing debate over President Obama's deportation relief policies.

"State officials announced major water cutbacks for Northern California farmers Friday, a historic step that could challenge claims the agriculture industry is getting a free pass during the state's epic drought.The cutbacks will affect some of California's oldest water rights holders — farmers who laid claim to surface water more than a century ago — for the first time in four decades. They will not be allowed to draw water from the San Joaquin River, the Sacramento River and the delta that forms where the two rivers meet. State officials said the rivers simply don't have enough water to meet the demands of all rights holders.This isn't the first time during the current drought that state has cut off supplies to surface water users, including farmers. The water board has already ""curtailed"" nearly 9,000 water rights this year, all of them ""junior"" water rights that were established post-1914.But for the first time since a severe drought in the late 1970s, California is starting to tell ""senior"" water rights holders, who laid claim to surface water before 1914, that there just isn't enough water for them. The cutbacks announced Friday impact rights holders who established their claims between 1903 and 1914.And more historic cuts could be coming over the summer. The State Water Resources Control Board said Friday that it's continuing to monitor conditions in watersheds across the state, and that cutbacks could be on the horizon for even more senior rights holders.""Curtailment notices for other watersheds and for more senior water right holders in these watersheds may be imminent,"" the water board said in a statement.State officials said in a conference call that the water rights being curtailed comprise 1.2 million acre-feet, but it's unclear whether the cutbacks will save quite that much.

"Updated at 10:04 a.m. ETThe Vatican has announced an end to an overhaul of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious — an abrupt conclusion to a five-year doctrinal overhaul of the main umbrella group for nuns in the U.S. that began in 2012.The Vatican said Thursday that it has accepted a report on the overhaul of the LCWR ""marking the conclusion of the Doctrinal Assessment"" of the umbrella group.NPR's Sylvia Poggioli tells our Newscast unit the unexpected announcement is seen as a sign of Pope Francis' focus on a more merciful church.LCWR leaders met with Pope Francis later Thursday, during their annual visit to Rome. David Gibson of Religion News Service described the meeting as ""another indicator of the thaw in relations."" He added:The Rev. James Martin, SJ., editor at large of the Jesuit magazine America, said in a Facebook post that the LCWR agreed to implement some changes, ""mainly regarding speakers and liturgies at its annual conventions. But overall, the operations of the LCWR remains intact.""Joshua J. McElwee, writing in the National Catholic Reporter, said the ""news seems to bring to an end what had been an especially contentious period between the women religious and the Vatican.""At issue was an investigation of the LCWR that began in 2012 under Cardinal William Levada, the previous head of the Vatican's theological watchdog. As NPR's Scott Neuman reported at the time, ""the Vatican issued a report declaring that the umbrella group representing most American nuns had strayed from church doctrine and adopted 'radical feminist' views. Rome ordered Seattle's archbishop to begin monitoring all operations of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious."" The investigation called for a five-year doctrinal overhaul of the group.Sister Simone Campbell, head of the Catholic social justice lobby Network, told NPR at the time that the investigation came ""like a sock in the stomach.""A separate Vatican investigation into U.S. nuns ended last December with the Vatican expressing what NPR's Sylvia Poggioli called ""appreciation for the dedicated work of nuns in education, health and among the poor.""","Transform the text into a board game concept, with mechanics inspired by the story's themes or events.","Doctrinal Journey:**- Players move through a circular board representing the journey of the LCWR through the five years of doctrinal overhaul.- Each space on the board has a specific theme or event related to the overhaul.- To move forward, players must complete tasks that represent the steps taken by the LC"

"For the first time in months, a national poll shows Donald Trump is not leading the Republican 2016 primary race, and instead has Ben Carson in first place.Carson won the support of 26% of Republican primary voters, compared to 22% who are backing Trump, according to CBS News/New York Times .

And in New Hampshire, Trump's lead has also slipped to 5 points ahead of Fiorina -- down from 10 points just two weeks ago. Trump also took the opportunity Tuesday to once again slam Sen.

"Administrators at the popular online forum Reddit have been accused of censorship after quarantining a subreddit titled 'european.'Subreddits, which are also known as communities, are forums dedicated to specific topics.“The administration has decided to censor free speech for Europeans and they quarantined the subreddit on the 12th of May 2016,” says a note on the subreddit link. With the subreddit set to private, the note adds that “You must be a moderator or approved submitter to visit.” Visitors to the subreddit were also urged to continue their discussions on Voat, another online forum.The question of bias in social media has erupted recently. The Reddit accusation came just days after anonymous allegations that contractors at Facebook deliberately suppressed conservative news on the site’s Trending Topics section. Facebook has denied any political bias, saying there is “no evidence” of the alleged activity.Reddit told FoxNews.com that the 'european' subreddit violated the forum's content policy. ""Quarantines on Reddit are rare - there are thousands of vibrant conversations flourishing on the site every day,"" it explained, in an emailed statement.

""The quarantine process doesn’t end the conversation; it adds an opt-in measure so that people have the choice to join the conversation,"" it added.Restrictions on a quarantined subreddit include requiring an explicit opt-in, requiring an account with a verified email address, no use of custom images and the removal of revenue generation.Related: Reddit updates content policy, bans a 'handful' of groups that exist 'solely to annoy' othersThe ‘european’ quarantining prompted a mixed reaction elsewhere on Reddit.

Chris Christie (R) came out as a vaccine choicer Tuesday, saying it should be up to parents to decide whether to inoculate their children against deadly diseases that could infect the rest of the population.His stance was looser than the one he took last year against Kaci Hickox, the nurse Christie forcibly quarantined over Ebola fears when she returned to the United States after helping patients in West Africa. There was never any evidence that Hickox had symptoms of Ebola, a far less contagious disease than the measles, which is currently spreading across the country due to parents who refuse to vaccinate their children.On Monday night, Hickox went on ""All In with Chris Hayes"" on MSNBC and blasted Christie for his vaccination comments.""I think this is a good example of Gov. Christie making some very ill-informed statements. We heard it a lot during the Ebola discussion, and now it seems to have happened again,"" said Hickox.""We know that vaccines are safe, and we know that vaccines save lives,"" she said. ""I have worked in a measles outbreak in northern Nigeria before. We were seeing about 2,000 children a week with measles. It is a scary disease. I know that these families of these 100 people who have the disease now could tell you a little bit about what the disease looks like and how much misery it causes.

"WASHINGTON -- Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is confident there will be no government shutdown this fall because Republicans are in charge on Capitol Hill, he said Friday.""I’m not worried about that because we control both sides of the rotunda, the House and the Senate,"" Ryan, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a briefing with reporters.Ryan is optimistic despite the fact that the House has only passed about half of the 12 appropriations measures that are required to keep the government running through September, the Senate hasn't passed any yet, and Congress is on vacation for most of August.Democrats in the upper chamber are blocking the funding measures there because they are angry that the GOP decided to boost military spending above levels set by the 2011 Budget Control Act and its sequestration rules, while leaving in place steep cuts to domestic programs that are Democratic priorities.President Barack Obama has threatened to veto appropriations bills that don't deal with both military and domestic programs, and his allies in the Senate are demanding that Republicans open up a process now to resolve the impasse. Ryan managed to cut a deal with Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash) two years ago, when both were chairs of their respective budget committees, that eased sequestration cuts evenly.Neither Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) nor House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) have suggested any willingness to do something similar this time around, and Senate Democrats are vowing to stand firm until Republicans start negotiating.Ryan said that he thought a new version of a Ryan-Murray deal could be struck under the leadership of the current budget chairmen, Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) and Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.).But he stuck by his party's line that Congress should keep passing its regular funding bills before starting to negotiate, pointing to the Department of Defense bill that is currently being blocked.""If they filibuster DOD approps over there in the Senate, I think it's a shame if they do that, but we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it,"" he said.Asked if he could support raising the spending caps set in 2011's deal -- as he and Murray did in 2013 -- he didn't say no, but insisted such a move would have to be paid for in some way.""The precedent that Patty and I set was mandatory savings in excess of discretionary add-backs to result in deficit reduction -- net deficit reduction,"" he said.""These things have to be paid for,"" Ryan added, ""What's the point in having spending caps if they don't enforce fiscal discipline?""Asked why Republican control made him optimistic about passing appropriations bills, especially considering the poor functioning of the Senate, Ryan merely replied: ""It's functioning a whole lot better than it did a year ago,"" when Democrats were in charge.When Congress did shut down the government for two weeks in 2013, Republicans only controlled the House, but they got the blame because they had insisted on trying to use government funding to gut the Affordable Care Act.",Convert into a dialogue between two people with opposing views on the subject.,"**Rep.

"SHARM EL-SHEIK, Egypt, March 14 (Reuters) - On the eve of fresh talks with Iran, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said it was unclear whether an interim agreement over its nuclear power program was within reach.""I can't tell you whether or not we can get a deal, whether we are close,"" Kerry told a news conference on Saturday in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik, where he attended an Egyptian investment summit.""The purpose of these negotiations is not just to get a deal, it is to get the right deal,"" he added.The United States and five other major powers -- Britain, Germany, France, China and Russia -- will resume negotiations with Iran in Lausanne, Switzerland, from Sunday. They hope to clinch a framework agreement by the end of the month.The two sides would then seek to negotiate by June 30 a final agreement to would curb Iran's most sensitive nuclear activities for at least 10 years. In exchange, sanctions on the Islamic Republic would gradually end.Kerry expressed concern again that a letter to Iran last week from Republican senators may have undermined the talks. The letter warned Iran that any deal made by President Barack Obama might last only as long as he remained in office -- a highly unusual intervention in U.S. foreign policy-making.Kerry said he would assure Iranian negotiators and Europeans allies during the upcoming talks that Congress did not have the authority to change the deal.""As far as we're concerned, Congress has no ability to change an executive agreement,"" Kerry said, adding that ""important gaps"" still remained between the sides.The letter followed a speech to Congress earlier this month by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who warned that Obama was negotiating a ""bad deal"" with Iran. Republicans invited Netanyahu to speak about Iran without consulting the White House or Democrats.With Israel preparing to elect a new government next week, Kerry said the United States hoped that whatever the outcome it would help push forward the peace process with Palestinians.""President Obama remains committed to a two-state solution,"" Kerry said, adding ""he remains hopeful that whatever choice that people of Israel make, that there will be an ability to be able to move forward on those efforts.""He declined to elaborate on the prospects of resuming the talks, with an election just days away.Peace talks broke down in April 2014 after nine months of negotiations led by Kerry, with the long-standing goal of a two-state solution no closer.Abbas has steered clear of taking a position on the Israeli election, saying only that he was ready to work with who wins.

"Republican Donald Trump appears to have carved out a wider path to the White House as a number of states including Florida and Ohio are no longer considered likely wins for Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project released on Saturday.The project, which combines opinion polls with an analysis of voting patterns under different election scenarios, still shows Clinton would have the best chance of winning the presidency if the Nov. 8 election were held today. Yet Trump has caught up to her level of support in several states.Clinton now has an 83 percent chance of winning the election by an average of 47 votes in the Electoral College, the body that ultimately selects the president. In late August, the States of the Nation estimated that Clinton had a 95 percent chance of winning by an average of 108 electoral votes.Over the past few weeks, Clinton's lead in the national polls has slipped considerably. Polls tend to narrow as Election Day nears, and the Clinton campaign has struggled to overcome controversy about how she handled classified information while serving as secretary of state.A separate Reuters/Ipsos poll of likely voters showed an 8-point lead for Clinton has vanished since the last week of August.Clinton is still favored to win 17 states, including many with large, urban populations such as New York, New Jersey and California that heavily influence the outcome of the election. Trump would likely win 23 states, many of them with smaller populations.The number of states projected for Clinton has dropped over the past few weeks. Two of those states, Ohio and Florida, were considered likely wins for Clinton in late August. Now the candidates are about even in support. Five more states, including Michigan and North Carolina are also up for grabs.The sample size was insufficient to determine the outcome in Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska and the District of Columbia, though Alaska usually votes Republican and Washington D.C. for the Democratic Party candidate.The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project is driven by an online survey that gathers responses from about 15,000 people per week.

"""2014 was the planet's warmest year on record. Fourteen of the 15 hottest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century,"" Obama said. ""Yes, this winter was cold in parts of our country, including Washington. Some people in Washington helpfully used a snowball to illustrate that fact. But around the world, in the aggregate, it was the warmest winter ever recorded.""It's of course a huge coincidence that the visit is in the backyard of two Republican presidential hopefuls who have been squishy on the subject of climate change, and a Republican governor who reportedly told state employees they can't even use the words ""climate change.""""Climate change can no longer be denied,"" Obama said. ""It can't be edited out. It can't be omitted from the conversation. And action can no longer be delayed.""   Ahead of the visit, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on a call that Obama would ""use the occasion of Earth Day to highlight his commitment to fighting to protect public health and to fighting the carbon pollution that contributes to climate change."" And the president picked Florida, Earnest said, because it's a place ""where these kinds of issues have traditionally been bipartisan.""Earnest was coy about the fact that Florida also happens to be the home of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio, two likely Republican presidential contenders who haven't been as enthusiastic about climate action. Bush has said he's a ""skeptic"" when it comes to climate change, while Rubio says he doesn't believe human activity is causing the planet to heat up.The president, Earnest said on the call, hopes the visit ""will prompt an elevated political debate about making climate change a priority."" However, he added, the trip is ""not an effort to go to anyone's home state, but to raise the debate.""Earnest maintained that Obama's visit ""isn't about campaigns, this is about making progress on a priority."" But he also noted that ""the Republicans who choose to deny the reality of climate change, they do that to the detriment of the people they're elected to represent.""Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), also no big fan of the concept of climate change, has taken to Twitter to criticize Obama's Everglades visit. Scott argued that the president should do more to get federal funding for Everglades restoration, because, he said, ""Our environment is too important to neglect.""Earnest fired back against Scott on Wednesday. ""It's a little tough to take criticism from someone who has banned the words 'climate change' for the accusation that the president has been insufficiently committed to fighting climate change,"" he said, referring to reports that Florida officials were forbidden from using the terms ""global warming"" and ""climate change"" in official communications. ""That's a tough case to make, but it sounds like that didn't stop him.""The White House also used the occasion to tout the benefits of the National Park Service, which will celebrate its 100th anniversary next year. A new report from the NPS released Wednesday finds that every dollar invested in the parks returns $10 to the U.S. economy through tourism and other related industries.

"After the Paris attacks, Americans are divided on Obama’s plan to let in 10,000 Syrian refugees. The timing is good: Thanksgiving can shed light on how much the nation’s tradition of hospitality should influence this decision.Syria refugee Nedal Al-Hayk works as a fabricator in Warren, Mich. Several U.S. governors are threatening to halt efforts to allow Syrian refugees into their states in the aftermath of the coordinated attacks in Paris, though an immigration expert says they have no legal authority to do so.Just as Americans prepare to express their hospitality toward others during Thanksgiving, a national debate has erupted over another kind of hospitality: President Obama’s plan to welcome 10,000 Syrian refugees into the United States. After the Paris attacks, the plan has been widely challenged, not least by nearly half the US governors. They fear Islamic State terrorists might slip in as “sleepers” among the refugees. Others argue back that the US already rigorously vets all asylum seekers – for as long as two years.Might Thanksgiving, with all its traditions and meaning, shed some light on this debate?The practice of welcoming strangers into one’s home or community long precedes the first American thanksgiving, that autumn feast of 1621 when Pilgrims and native Americans expressed gratitude for either the harvest, each other, or God’s mercy (or all of the above). Hospitality is an ancient Middle East virtue, rooted in the traditions of desert tribes and deeply encoded in the three Abrahamic religions. In the scriptural book of Hebrews, we read: “Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.”Hospitality, like Thanksgiving, is a type of giving that treats others – rich or poor, stranger or family – as equals. In ancient days, this egalitarian focus was symbolized by the washing of a guest’s feet. Today it serves as a cornerstone for democracy. It is also the basis for the United Nations Refugee Convention, in which a majority of the world’s states have agreed to grant asylum to people deemed to be refugees.In the US, a thanksgiving day was not an official holiday until Lincoln made it one during the Civil War. The woman who championed it, Sarah Hale, wrote in 1864: “Let us each see to it that on this one day there shall be no family or individual, within the compass of our means to help, who shall not have some portion prepared, and some reason to join in the general Thanksgiving.”Granting permanent asylum in the US to a refugee, of course, is not the same as sharing a turkey dinner with a stranger. Today’s modern nation-states are careful about who crosses their borders, either to prevent problems or to enhance their society. But with 1 in every 122 people now either a refugee, internally displaced, or seeking asylum, the need for hospitality is great. And in hospitality a nation can find its greatness.","Write as an interactive web story, where readers choose how to explore the topic.","It effectively uses Thanksgiving as a metaphor to explore the concept of hospitality and its impact on society.Here are some key points the text highlights:* The timing of the debate coincides with Thanksgiving, a time when Americans traditionally practice hospitality.* Some governors are threatening to"
"As Congress's vote on a resolution to disapprove the administration's nuclear deal draws ever nearer, the math for President Obama is looking better and better.The magic number of Senate supporters the president needs to ensure that the deal stands is 34. Currently, he has 30. So he needs to pick up just four more to preserve the agreement — and there are still 14 remaining undecided Democrats in the chamber, several of whom have already made positive comments about the deal. So Obama has a lot of options.And tellingly, after a month of intense criticism of the deal from the right and from pro-Israel groups, only two Senate Democrats have been swayed to oppose the deal so far: Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York and Bob Menendez of New Jersey. They'll be joined by, it appears, every single Senate Republican.But that wouldn't be enough to sink the deal. If opponents want to block the sanctions relief that's crucial to the agreement, they need to assemble a two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate that can override a promised veto from Obama. And that's impossible to reach without a lot of Democratic votes, as I wrote in July:Deal opponents once hoped that the agreement would become politically toxic, leading to many Democratic defections. But that hasn't happened. Instead, the key swing votes — including some of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate, like Claire McCaskill and Joe Donnelly — have been won over by the administration.The state of play in the House is tougher for outsiders to gauge, but opponents appear to be well short of the 44 Democratic opponents they need there — just 14 Democrats have said they'll vote to kill the deal, according to the Hill. Again, the deal's opponents would need a veto-proof majority in both the Senate and the House to keep the sanctions in place.According to a Friday report from Eli Lake and Josh Rogin of Bloomberg View, deal opponents have already resigned themselves to losing the vote eventually. Furthermore, they write, ""Many Republicans now acknowledge in private that they were handed both a political and a policy defeat on the nuclear deal.""Now that the deal looks so likely to be upheld, the new question is whether Democrats can save President Obama from having to veto it in the first place.There wouldn't be any policy stakes here — achieving this would simply save the president from the embarrassment of Congress passing a resolution condemning his administration's foreign policy.For that to happen, 41 Senate Democrats would have to vote to filibuster the GOP's planned disapproval resolution — meaning Obama would need to win over 11 of the remaining 14 undecided Democrats in the chamber. That's a tall order, but given that only two Democratic senators have opposed the deal so far, it doesn't seem completely out of the question.The vote will likely take place in mid-September. But if you want to keep track yourself beforehand, here are the remaining undecided Democratic senators. Again, the administration needs to win four of their votes to uphold the deal, and 11 for a filibuster that would make a veto unnecessary:",Present the information as a series of Instagram-style photo captions.,"The math is looking good for President Obama. He needs 34 Senate supporters to ensure the nuclear deal stands, and he currently has 30. He needs to pick up just four more votes, and there are still 14 remaining undecided Democrats in the chamber.It's a close call, but Obama has a lot of options. He's already won over some of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate, and it appears that every single Senate"
"In what was an emotional and contentious scene at the Rowan County, Ky., Courthouse this morning, one dramatic legal standoff came to an end when a gay couple was issued a marriage license.James Yates and William Smith, who had tried this five times before, arrived at the courthouse just as the sun started peeking out from under the mountains on the horizon.They walked past protesters — some condemning them and some cheering them — and entered the clerk's office.Kim Davis, the county clerk who had stood in their way those five previous attempts, was in jail. She was held in contempt by a federal judge Thursday for refusing to hand out marriage licenses in defiance of the U.S. Supreme Court. So early Friday, Yates and Smith walked up to Deputy Clerk Brian Mason.Mason was all business. He checked their licenses, asked them if they were related, took their $35 and, in about five minutes, handed them an envelope and said, ""Congratulations.""Yates and Smith had become the first same-sex couple to receive a marriage license from Rowan County.They exited to chants of ""Love has won. Love has won.""""I don't want her in jail,"" Yates said of Davis. ""No one wanted her in jail. We just wanted the licenses given out. This isn't a blessing. It's an official license.""""This means, at least for this area, civil rights are civil rights and they're not subject to beliefs.""Davis' husband, Joe Davis, was also outside the courthouse with a group of protesters who called this a moral fight.""We don't hate these people.

"WASHINGTON -- Leaders from more than 70 cities and counties, some going against their states, joined a legal brief filed Monday asking an appeals court to allow President Barack Obama's deportation relief policies to move forward.""Continuing to delay implementation of the president’s executive action on immigration hurts our economy and puts families at risk,"" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), who spearheaded the effort with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) as part of Cities United for Immigration Action, said in a statement.""Cities are where immigrants live, and cities are where the president's executive action will be successfully implemented,"" he continued. ""Our cities are united, and we will fight for the immigration reform this nation needs and deserves -- whether in the courtroom, in Congress, or in our communities. Make no mistake about it: our voices will be heard.""Under the policies Obama announced in November, as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants with longstanding ties to the U.S. may be able to stay and work temporarily.Twenty-six states, led by Texas, filed the lawsuit, arguing the relief programs would cause them harm and violate the Constitution. They've won support from some Republican members of Congress and governors.But 14 states and the District of Columbia, including some led by Republicans, filed an amicus brief, saying the programs should be allowed to move forward.Garcetti and de Blasio spearheaded a similar brief in January and received about 30 signatures. The latest brief is backed by mayors, county executives and governments from 73 cities and counties in 27 states. The National League of Cities and the U.S. Conference of Mayors also have joined the brief. The cities and counties are home to 43 million people, according to organizers of the brief.Some cities signing onto the brief are in states that joined the lawsuit against the president's executive actions. Houston, the most populous city in Texas, is part of the cities' and counties' brief, as is the state capital, Austin. Cities and counties in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Arizona, Ohio, Indiana, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Florida and Utah also signed on, even though their states are suing over the executive actions.The brief argues the executive actions would be good for public safety and the economy in their cities and counties, and would help immigrants integrate and keep families together. The delay in implementing Obama's orders, the brief argues, ""harms their cities and counties and all residents thereof by forestalling the critical benefits of that action.""The Obama administration is seeking a ruling to allow the programs to move forward. The Justice Department filed an appeal last week asking the court to lift the injunction.UPDATE: 3:45 p.m. -- Nearly every House Democrat -- 181 of them -- signed on to another amicus brief filed on Monday asking the appeals court to lift the preliminary injunction on Obama's immigration policies.The House Democrats' amicus brief says that they ""well understand the importance of ensuring that the executive does not exceed its constitutional or statutory authority."" But it goes on to say that the lawmakers understand the executive has the authority to use its discretion in enforcing the law.""The broad discretionary authority to set removal policies and priorities is both explicit and implicit in the Nation’s immigration laws and has been exercised also by prior Administrations of both parties in ways consistent with the Secretary’s actions,"" the brief states, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson.",Reframe the text as an open letter to a public figure or organization mentioned in the story.,"Dear President Obama,I am writing to you in my capacity as a concerned citizen and resident of the city of [Your City].

"Why are Americans expected to die sooner than their peers in other high-income countries?A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association takes a look at the question. The results are, well, not too surprising — three of the big drivers for the year analyzed, 2012, were guns, drugs, and cars.The study looked at these causes of injury deaths, which are the three biggest causes of injury death in the US and altogether account for more than 100,000 early deaths each year in America. It compared how common these deaths are in the US versus other high-income countries — the UK, Denmark, Sweden, Japan, and eight others — with 2012 data from the US National Vital Statistics System and the World Health Organization Mortality Database.It found that, on average, men and women in the other high-income countries can expect to live about 2.2 years longer than men and women in the US — and guns, drugs, and cars played a prominent role.Among men, gun deaths explained 21 percent of the gap, drug overdoses 14 percent, and car crashes 13 percent. And among women, gun deaths explained 4 percent, drug overdoses 9 percent, and car crashes 6 percent.In total, the death rate for guns, drugs, and cars was much, much higher in the US than its developed peers, as this chart shows:""Although the reasons for the gap in life expectancy at birth between the United States and comparable countries are complex,"" study authors Andrew Fenelon, Li-Hui Chen, and Susan Baker wrote, ""a substantial portion of this gap reflects just three causes of injury.""So why do Americans die more from these causes? There are cultural factors, but bad policy plays a role too.With guns, the research shows that America's unusually high levels of gun ownership lead to more gun violence. Other factors, such as socioeconomic issues, contribute to violence, but guns are the one issue that makes America unique relative to other developed countries in comparable socioeconomic circumstances. (To learn more about America's gun problem, read Vox's explainer.)""A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,"" UC Berkeley's Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins wrote in a breakthrough analysis in 1999. ""A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.""Some research also shows tightening existing gun control measures in the US would help: Studies in both Connecticut and Missouri suggested that gun licensing laws in those states helped reduce homicides and suicides.With drugs, America is now in the middle of a harrowing opioid and heroin epidemic that's killing tens of thousands of people each year. (For an in-depth dive on this topic, read Vox's explainer.)Academic analyses of the crisis have concluded that the US was too slow to respond to misleading advertising campaigns from opioid producers, in which they claimed that their drugs were safe and effective. Americans have suffered the consequences, getting addicted to and dying from opioid painkillers and heroin as pharmaceutical companies have massively profited.With cars, by the 1960s European policies began encouraging walking, cycling, and public transportation. The US, meanwhile, continued to encourage sprawl and driving. The result: Americans drive much more than their European peers, and are more likely to die in crashes as a result. (To learn more about US and European transportation policy, read Ralph Buehler's great explainer at the Atlantic's CityLab.)Even perfect policies might not fix all of these problems — Americans, after all, love their guns, drugs, and cars, and that cultural preference will likely remain strong for some time. But better policies could push the US in the right direction — and save lives.",Summarize the article as a catchy song lyric.,"Why Americans Die Sooner, It's a Sad SongIn the US, death comes early,Guns, drugs, and cars take their toll,A new study shows, it's not a myth.Three big drivers of death,The study found, it's not a secret,In the US, the rate is high,In other countries, people live longer.Men and women, they die less,The"
"The federal government must make regular interest payments on the money it has borrowed to finance past deficits – that is, on the national debt held by the public.The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the federal government’s net interest payments on that debt will total $229 billion in the 2015 fiscal year.

It’s projected that net interest costs will more than triple over the next decade, reaching $808 billion in 2025.These numbers pose a real threat. The CBO has issued warnings about the serious negative consequences that such high and rising debt and interest payments on the debt could have on both the economy and the federal budget.“The large amount of debt might restrict policymakers’ ability to use tax and spending policies to respond to unexpected future challenges, such as economic downturns or financial crises,” the CBO said in a recent report.In the same report, they also cautioned that continued growth in the debt could lead investors to doubt the government’s willingness or ability to pay its obligations, which would require the government to pay much higher interest rates on its borrowing going forward.","If the original text is opinionated, rewrite it to present the information in an unbiased, journalistic news format.","The federal government is obligated to make regular interest payments on the national debt it has accumulated to finance past deficits.

"He's combative. He rejects compromise as ""the mushy middle."" He's not inclined to wait his turn. And he doesn't seem to mind annoying his Republican elders with tactics that critics see as destructive and short-sighted.So perhaps it's no surprise that little more than two years after he was sworn in to the Senate, the 44-year-old Texan on Monday became the first contender to officially announce his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. He skipped the one-step-at-a-time tradition of announcing an ""exploratory"" committee to declare flatly that he was in the race.""It's going to take a new generation of courageous conservatives to help make America great again,"" Cruz said in a 30-second video he posted on Twitter early Monday morning, followed by a speech at Liberty University, ""and I'm ready to stand with you to lead the fight.""He won't be lonely for long. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is slated to announce his candidacy in two weeks, likely followed in short order by yet another Republican senator, Marco Rubio of Florida. That's not to mention the governors (Wisconsin's Scott Walker, New Jersey's Chris Christie, Louisiana's Bobby Jindal), the former governors (Florida's Jeb Bush, Texas' Rick Perry, Arkansas' Mike Huckabee), the former senators (Pennsylvania's Rick Santorum) and the others who already are visiting Iowa and New Hampshire and hiring staffers for nascent campaigns.At his speech, a handful of students in a prominent front row sported red ""Stand With Rand"" sweatshirts.Cruz has been overshadowed in recent months by Bush, Walker and other contenders who have more muscular fundraising networks and stronger institutional support. In the Senate, he has been more of an agitator than a legislator. Arizona Sen. John McCain, the GOP's 2008 nominee, once called him a ""wacko bird.""That said, Cruz is worth watching.For one thing, the skills he honed as a college debater at Princeton — he was named U.S. National Speaker of the Year in 1992 — should serve him well in the series of crowded primary debates.For another, while his Tea Party credentials might be a mixed blessing in a general election, in the primaries they align him with the most energized forces in the Republican grass roots today. That helped him upset the establishment's favorite, lieutenant governor David Dewhurst, for the Republican Senate nomination in 2012.What's more, the locale Cruz chose to make Monday's announcement reflects his efforts to broaden his electoral base by wooing Christian conservatives, another key group in the GOP coalition. He spoke at the Lynchburg, Va., school founded by evangelical leader Jerry Falwell that describes itself on its website as the largest Christian university in the world.His speech had the ring of the religious testimony of an evangelical church. He declared his opposition to abortion and his support of traditional marriage. He emotionally described how his father's embrace of Jesus saved his parents' marriage. His father, Rafael, a pastor at a suburban Dallas church, fled Castro's Cuba in 1957.Cruz's Cuban-American heritage would be a selling point for the Republican Party as it tries to reach out to Hispanic voters, although his hardline stance on immigration could be a complication with those voters. And speaking of biography, he has an education that might surprise those inclined to dismiss him: He was graduated from Princeton and then from Harvard Law School, magna cum laude, before clerking at the Supreme Court for Chief Justice William Rehnquist.At one point, he urged his audience to ""take out your cellphones"" and text the word ""Constitution"" or ""Liberty"" — ""we're flexible,"" he said — to a number linked to his campaign.","Reframe the text as a pilot's log, navigating through the events or ideas as if on a journey.","My journey through the political landscape on this fine Monday began with a splash, as the 44-year-old Texan Senator, Ted Cruz, took the stage to announce his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.The air crackled with anticipation as I watched him unveil his intentions, skipping the customary ""exploratory"" committee step and diving headfirst into the race.

"The Senate on Tuesday voted to block the controversial legislation cracking down on the so-called ""sanctuary cities"" that shield residents from federal immigration authorities.Following an impassioned speeches by Texas' Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and New Jersey's Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez arguing, respectively, for and against the Sanctuary Cities Bill, the Senate voted 54-46 against the legislation.The bill has divided Congress along partisan lines and gained national attention in the wake of GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump's harsh words on immigration and the shooting death of a California woman over the summer by an undocumented immigrant.""We are witnessing the most overtly nativist and xenophobic campaign in modern U.S. history,"" Menendez said on Tuesday. ""We've hit a new low with the extraordinarily hateful rhetoric that diminishes immigrants' contributions to American history — and particularly demonizes the Latino community by labeling Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals.""The bill, which went up for procedural vote on Tuesday, was authored by Louisiana Sen. David Vitter. It would have punished jurisdictions that prohibit the collection of immigration information or don't cooperate with federal requests, blocking them from receiving certain grants and funds.Republicans have pushed the bill since the July 1 shooting of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco. The man charged in the killing was in the country illegally despite a long criminal record and multiple prior deportations.

"Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) has endorsed Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) to succeed him after he retires at the end of 2016.""I think Schumer should be able to succeed me,"" Reid said in a Friday morning interview at his home in Washington's West End.Reid predicted that Schumer, the No. 3 Senate Democrat in leadership and a close friend, would win the Democratic leader post without opposition. He said that the other likely contender, Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), would stand down for Schumer.Reid and Durbin spoke by phone at about 11 a.m. Friday.Reid called Schumer ""extremely smart"" and noted the brash, energetic New Yorker would have a ""different style"" than his own soft talking demeanor.Seemingly comfortable with his decision to not run for re-election, Reid said the liberal wing of the Democratic Party should have faith in Schumer, whose ties to Wall Street fueled his fundraising prowess and helped Democrats win the majority in 2006 and expand it to a super-majority in 2009. Those ties have some liberals questioning whether Schumer should lead the party, but Reid said that Sens.

"Administrators at the popular online forum Reddit have been accused of censorship after quarantining a subreddit titled 'european.'Subreddits, which are also known as communities, are forums dedicated to specific topics.“The administration has decided to censor free speech for Europeans and they quarantined the subreddit on the 12th of May 2016,” says a note on the subreddit link. With the subreddit set to private, the note adds that “You must be a moderator or approved submitter to visit.” Visitors to the subreddit were also urged to continue their discussions on Voat, another online forum.The question of bias in social media has erupted recently. The Reddit accusation came just days after anonymous allegations that contractors at Facebook deliberately suppressed conservative news on the site’s Trending Topics section. Facebook has denied any political bias, saying there is “no evidence” of the alleged activity.Reddit told FoxNews.com that the 'european' subreddit violated the forum's content policy. ""Quarantines on Reddit are rare - there are thousands of vibrant conversations flourishing on the site every day,"" it explained, in an emailed statement. ""Subreddits are quarantined only when the content is clearly offensive to the broader Reddit community.""Quarantining aims to prevent the content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not wish to do so.""A subreddit is quarantined when there are concerns that its content is extreme and could be offensive to people outside of that community,"" explained Reddit. ""The quarantine process doesn’t end the conversation; it adds an opt-in measure so that people have the choice to join the conversation,"" it added.Restrictions on a quarantined subreddit include requiring an explicit opt-in, requiring an account with a verified email address, no use of custom images and the removal of revenue generation.Related: Reddit updates content policy, bans a 'handful' of groups that exist 'solely to annoy' othersThe ‘european’ quarantining prompted a mixed reaction elsewhere on Reddit. Some users say that racist views were expressed on the subreddit, while others say that it hosted a range of opinions and cite the importance of open dialogue.Reddit, which had over 277 million unique visitors last month, uses teams of volunteers to moderate subreddits.The forum updated its content policy last year, consolidating multiple rules and policies into a single set of guidelines.A blogger with an interest in numbers, who uses the name Curious Gnu, recently crunched a Reddit dataset of 4.6 million comments and noted that 78 percent of Reddit threads with over 1,000 comments mention Nazis or Hitler. The blogger found that around 2.6 percent of comments in the ‘european’ subreddit mentioned Nazis or Hitler. A slightly higher percentage of comments on the ‘AskHistorians’ subreddit mentioned Nazis or Hitler, with around 2.75 percent of comments on the ‘history’ subreddit referencing the topics.Related: No censorship in Chinese Internet, says China's top censorReddit prohibits illegal content, spam, publication of someone’s private and confidential information, sexually suggestive content featuring minors and anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people.

"With the provisions of the Patriot Act which allow the National Security Administration to collect data on Americans' phone calls newly expired, a new CNN/ORC poll finds 61% of Americans think the law ought to be renewed, including majorities across party lines, while 36% say it should not be reinstated.Republican leaders in the Senate are working to pass a bill to reinstate the law, after delays led by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky), whose presidential campaign has been noted for its appeal to independent voters and younger Republicans, and other surveillance opponents led to the law's expiration at 12:01 a.m. Monday. But Paul's stance on the issue is unlikely to bring him many fans within his own party.Support for renewal peaks among Republicans, 73% of whom back the law. Democrats largely agree, with 63% saying the law should be renewed. Independents are least apt to back it, with 55% saying renew it and 42% let it expire. Liberals, regardless of partisan affiliation, are most likely to say the law should not be renewed, 50% say so while 48% want to see it renewed.About half of Americans, 52%, say that if the law is not renewed, the risk of terrorism here in the U.S. would remain about the same. Still, a sizable 44% minority feel that without the law, the risk of terrorism will rise. Just 3% feel it would decrease.RELATED: Rand Paul vs. the GOP field on NSA The sense that the risk will rise is greatest among Republicans, 61% of whom say the risk of terrorism will climb if the NSA is unable to collect this data. Among Democrats and independents, less than half feel the risk of terrorism would increase if the program ended. The poll reveals a steep generational divide on the data collection program. Among those under age 35, just 25% say the risk of terrorism would increase without NSA data collection. That more than doubles to 60% among those age 65 or older. Those under age 35 are also split on whether the law should be renewed at all, 50% say it should be renewed while 49% say it should not. Among those age 35 or older, 65% back renewal of the law. President Barack Obama's reviews for handling government surveillance of U.S. citizens have worsened since June 2013 when the NSA data collection program was first revealed. Overall, 67% say they disapprove of the president's handling of government surveillance of U.S. citizens, up from 61% in June 2013. Much of that decline comes among his fellow partisans. In June 2013, 61% of Democrats approved of the president's handling of surveillance issues, that has fallen to 49% in the new poll. Obama fares better on his handling of terrorism generally, 45% approve and 51% disapprove. The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone May 29-31 among a random national sample of 1,025 adults.

"Texas Senator Ted Cruz (R) isn’t about to let the facts get in the way of his narrative, so instead of admitting that his party’s rhetorical tantrums about hoax videos may have contributed to Robert Louis Dear’s decision to shoot up a Planned Parenthood clinic on Friday, he blamed it on what conservatives would consider a most loathsome manticore: a “transgendered leftist activist.”On Sunday, Cruz said that any attempt to link Dear to conservatives’ mission to curtail a woman’s right to choose is merely “vicious rhetoric on the left blaming those who are pro-life.” He claimed that “the media promptly wants to blame [Dear] on the pro-life movement, when at this point there’s very little evidence to indicate that.” Cruz, you see, is very, very concerned about people who make commonsense accusations based on reports that Dear was mumbling about “baby parts” when he was arrested. Repeating the Republican talking points about Planned Parenthood constitutes, to his mind, “very little evidence.”Solid evidence, for Cruz, comes from the person who has been deemed The Stupidest Man On The Internet, who discovered that Dear was listed as “Female” on a voter registration form, meaning he is obviously, as Cruz identified him, a “transgendered leftist activist.”Cruz made that statement while attempting to take the high road, but he’s unfamiliar with such heights and it showed. “It’s also been reported that he was registered as an independent and a woman and transgendered leftist activist, if that’s what he is,” he said. “I don’t think it’s fair to blame on the rhetoric on the left. This is a murderer.” Apparently, he believed people would walk away from his statement thinking, “It’s big of Cruz not to blame leftist rhetoric for a man shooting up a Planned Parenthood clinic” — which says quite a bit about how intelligent he considers his audience.Moreover, given that the only evidence Cruz has that Dear was transgender is a single voter registration form in which he identifies both as “Female” and “UAF,” which stands for “unaffiliated,” it stands to reason that he believes it impossible for a transgender person to be affiliated with the conservative movement in general or the Republican Party in particular. While that may be true, it’s also telling about who he assumes can find a home in the conservative coalition. As ThinkProgress’ Zack Ford reported, no one who knew him believed he identified as a woman, and his ex-wife claimed that “he believed wholeheartedly in the Bible,” but that doesn’t constitute the kind of evidence a professional prevaricator like Cruz would consider worthy of mention. He should be commended, though, for his restraint in not arguing that Dear was simply a bank robber who took shelter in the Planned Parenthood clinic, another conservative canard that made the rounds this weekend.","Develop as a script for a 5-minute documentary, including narrator lines and interview quotes.","**Narrator:**""Texas Senator Ted Cruz (R) has sparked outrage with his latest remarks about the shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado.

"While Donald Trump doubled down this week on his vow to make Mexico pay for his proposed southern border wall, his campaign is reported to be weighing options that don’t necessarily involve the seemingly far-fetched scenario of the Mexican government handing America a great, big check.LifeZette first reported that the Republican presidential nominee and his top advisers are looking at using assets seized from drug cartels and other traffickers. This reportedly could involve establishing a “joint border security fund” -- holding seized assets from crackdowns on both sides of the border – for border construction and maintenance.Trump, asked Thursday by Fox News about the report, did not deny the option is on the table.“There are many ways that they can pay for the wall,” Trump said, calling it a “negotiation.”But he again insisted, “The United States will not be paying for the wall. Mexico will be paying for the wall.”Breitbart News, whose chairman Stephen Bannon left to be Trump’s campaign CEO, also reported that cartel resources would be seized to fund the wall if Trump wins.Trump supporter, and former presidential primary rival, Ben Carson floated another option Thursday night.Speaking with Fox News, Carson said money saved from enforcing the border could be used – though he did not elaborate on what level of savings the federal government could expect, particularly when Trump is proposing spending more money on border security resources.“Recognize that a lot of money is going to be saved by enforcing our borders, by not, you know, giving various types of benefits to people who are here illegally,” Carson said. “That money is money that we otherwise would not have had and that can be applied to the wall and various other things. That’s I believe the spirit in which that comment is made. I don't think Mexico is going to write a check out and say here, pay for the wall.”Trump has not addressed such details on the stump.He declared in his immigration policy speech Wednesday night that, “Mexico will pay for the wall … they don’t know it yet, but they’re going to pay.”That came after Trump met with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City, and both men left the meeting battling over the payment issue. Trump said they didn’t discuss “payment,” while Pena Nieto said he made clear Mexico will not put up the money.According to The Wall Street Journal, Trump added the line about payment into his Phoenix speech, in response to Pena Nieto’s claims.If a Trump administration did pursue using cartel assets to fund a wall, it would take billions. Trump has estimated the wall could be built for as little as $8 billion, though other analyses have put the cost much higher.Estimates of Mexican cartel revenue vary drastically. The U.S. government estimated a decade ago that Mexican traffickers make nearly $14 billion on drug sales to the U.S.","Transform the article into a board of directors' report, analyzing the story's events in a corporate context.","The story highlights the complex interplay between political rhetoric, economic considerations, and the potential for significant financial implications.In the context of a corporate setting, the article explores various options being considered by Trump's campaign.

"After the Paris attacks, Americans are divided on Obama’s plan to let in 10,000 Syrian refugees. The timing is good: Thanksgiving can shed light on how much the nation’s tradition of hospitality should influence this decision.Syria refugee Nedal Al-Hayk works as a fabricator in Warren, Mich. Several U.S. governors are threatening to halt efforts to allow Syrian refugees into their states in the aftermath of the coordinated attacks in Paris, though an immigration expert says they have no legal authority to do so.Just as Americans prepare to express their hospitality toward others during Thanksgiving, a national debate has erupted over another kind of hospitality: President Obama’s plan to welcome 10,000 Syrian refugees into the United States. After the Paris attacks, the plan has been widely challenged, not least by nearly half the US governors. They fear Islamic State terrorists might slip in as “sleepers” among the refugees. Others argue back that the US already rigorously vets all asylum seekers – for as long as two years.Might Thanksgiving, with all its traditions and meaning, shed some light on this debate?The practice of welcoming strangers into one’s home or community long precedes the first American thanksgiving, that autumn feast of 1621 when Pilgrims and native Americans expressed gratitude for either the harvest, each other, or God’s mercy (or all of the above). Hospitality is an ancient Middle East virtue, rooted in the traditions of desert tribes and deeply encoded in the three Abrahamic religions. In the scriptural book of Hebrews, we read: “Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.”Hospitality, like Thanksgiving, is a type of giving that treats others – rich or poor, stranger or family – as equals. In ancient days, this egalitarian focus was symbolized by the washing of a guest’s feet. Today it serves as a cornerstone for democracy. It is also the basis for the United Nations Refugee Convention, in which a majority of the world’s states have agreed to grant asylum to people deemed to be refugees.In the US, a thanksgiving day was not an official holiday until Lincoln made it one during the Civil War. The woman who championed it, Sarah Hale, wrote in 1864: “Let us each see to it that on this one day there shall be no family or individual, within the compass of our means to help, who shall not have some portion prepared, and some reason to join in the general Thanksgiving.”Granting permanent asylum in the US to a refugee, of course, is not the same as sharing a turkey dinner with a stranger. Today’s modern nation-states are careful about who crosses their borders, either to prevent problems or to enhance their society. But with 1 in every 122 people now either a refugee, internally displaced, or seeking asylum, the need for hospitality is great. And in hospitality a nation can find its greatness.","Develop as an email newsletter to clients, highlighting key points and implications.","It's a complex issue with various perspectives and implications.The timing of this debate coincides with Thanksgiving, a time when Americans traditionally express their hospitality to family, friends, and strangers. It's a tradition rooted in the practice of welcoming strangers into one's home or community."
"Why Negotiators At Paris Climate Talks Are Tossing The Kyoto ModelNegotiators and heads of state from nearly 200 countries are meeting for the next two weeks near Paris to craft a new treaty to slow global warming.It's the 21st ""Conference of the Parties"" held by the United Nations to tackle climate change. One treaty emerged, in 1997, after the conference in Kyoto, Japan. That's no longer in effect, and, in fact, the Kyoto Protocol, as it's known, didn't slow down the gradual warming of the planet.Now governments are ever more desperate to do something to slow warming — so much so that they've thrown out the model set in Kyoto and opted for a new approach for Paris.Valli Moosa, a former climate negotiator from South Africa, says the main reason Kyoto failed to slow warming lies largely with who wasn't included in the treaty. ""You actually cannot have a meaningful agreement without China and the United States being part of it,"" he says.The U.S. Senate refused to ratify the Kyoto treaty, so the world's biggest greenhouse-gas emitter didn't have skin in the game. And developing countries, including China and India, were not required to reduce emissions. Now those countries are becoming the biggest sources of greenhouse gases as their economies thrive. China, in fact, is now the world's biggest emitter, and India isn't far behind. Moreover, the Kyoto treaty had U.N. bureaucrats and negotiators setting goals for the participating countries to lower their greenhouse gases. Many countries didn't make their targets; others dropped out. Economies were at stake, and few countries were comfortable marching to a U.N. beat.So what negotiators are bringing to the table at the Paris talks is an arrangement whereby each country is offering to reduce its own emissions by whatever amount it can manage. And everybody participates, not just developed countries.Most nations arrive with a reduction target already in hand. What will be difficult is deciding who will pay how much to developing countries to build economies that won't keep producing high emissions.French negotiator Laurence Tubiana points out that the key to success is convincing governments that those economies can be ""low-carbon,"" and that this won't be a bar to developing wealth. ""How much I'm sacrificing for the sake of emissions reductions, that's no more,"" she says of the message that negotiators are pushing. ""And now ... the Chinese, even the Indians are really coming in. It's about low-carbon economy.""Previous attempts to replace the Kyoto treaty have failed. This new approach is voluntary, and most of the world has agreed theoretically to participate, which negotiators hope will sweeten things enough to get a deal. Still to be determined, however, is who will pay for this massive revolution in the world's energy economy, and what strings will be attached to their largesse.",Draft a brochure for a fictional theme park inspired by the article's themes.,"The Paris Climate Talks theme park is a fictional theme park inspired by the article ""Why Negotiators At Paris Climate Talks Are Tossing The Kyoto Model.""The park is divided into different sections, each representing a different aspect of the article.**The Kyoto Treaty Section:**This section includes a replica of the Kyoto Protocol and information about its failure to slow global warming.

"The water crisis in Flint, Mich., is just the tip of the iceberg – and if you think that it can’t happen in your community, you’re sadly mistaken. The aging water infrastructure in this country is deeply flawed. Many of the 150,000 public water systems that serve more than 300 million people are based on rusting, leaky pipes and decades-old plans that— if not corrected and replaced— will have devastating and long-lasting effects on our communities.The disaster in Flint, which began in 2014 when the city switched its water supply from Detroit’s system to the Flint River in a cost-saving measure, is likely brewing in many other communities. It is inconceivable to me that in the most developed nation on the planet, we have exposed families and young children to the poisonous effects of lead. And it is almost criminal to me that water supply officials were unaware that the water pumping through a large American city was endangering the community. That level of negligence is beyond comprehension.The dangerous, detrimental effects that lead can have on a developing brain and body are well-documented. In 1978, a largely successful campaign to remove lead from home paint products resulted in a new law, after it was found that small children could mistakenly eat paint chips and be exposed to lead poisoning. When it comes to levels of lead in water, no true amount is safe. However, in 1991 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established an action level for lead in public drinking water at 15 micrograms per liter, and required water supplies to routinely test household tap water to check lead levels.These laws and others were established to protect our citizens from both indirect and direct exposure to the harmful compound. A person can be directly exposed to lead by drinking contaminated water with unsafe levels, while indirect exposure can occur when a person inhales contaminated water particles through steam or vapors.Once lead enters the human body, the heavy metal attaches itself to cells that can begin to build up in bones or major organs like the liver or kidneys. It disrupts the normal cellular biology of the organ and can lead to chronic diseases. However, the most dangerous damage lead poisoning can inflict is on the brain, especially in young or unborn children. If lead is deposited in a developing fetal brain, it can disrupt the normal function and cause irreversible damage. The same can happen in young children whose brains are still maturing.The consequences can result in low IQ, severe delays in cognitive function, significant disruption in the memory center of the brain, learning disabilities and other neurological deficits. The devastating part of this diagnosis is that it is, for the most part, irreversible. Patients exposed to acute lead poisoning can be treated through chelation, which is a method used to filter out the lead. However, for children chronically exposed over a period of time, the damage cannot be undone.This makes the preventable crisis in Flint all the more devastating.I read that the Obama administration is planning to pick Dr. Nicole Lurie to act as a “czar” and fix the crisis in Flint, but I urge her to look further than just Michigan. Lurie and others must start to seriously evaluate other areas of America where the people are most susceptible to a disaster such as this. The government failed the city of Flint, it must act now to protect the rest of us.Dr. Manny Alvarez serves as Fox News Channel's senior managing health editor.

"CENTENNIAL, Colo. — Gone are the orange hair and the thousand-yard stare. In their place, trimmed hair, a shaggy beard and red-framed glasses.Sitting upright in court in a dark jacket, blue striped shirt and khaki slacks, James Holmes looking very much like the neuroscience graduate student he used to be, not a man on trial for his life.But Holmes, now 27, faces 12 murder charges in connection with the summer 2012 massacre at a suburban Denver movie theater's midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises. He could be executed if convicted. Holmes also faces dozens of other charges, including attempted murder. At least 70 were wounded in the massacre.Jury selection in the case began Tuesday afternoon, and Judge Carlos Samour said an initial pool of 9,000 jurors will be whittled down to 12, plus 12 alternates. The trial may last into October.Once opening statements get underway, cameras will be allowed in the courtroom. However, they are not allowed during jury selection.In a lengthy address to prosecutors and Holmes' defense team, Samour said he expects ""passionate and zealous"" courtroom arguments, but reminded both sides and prospective jurors that Holmes is innocent until proven guilty. The jury that will decide Holmes' guilt also will decide whether he should be executed.""What's most important to me is that justice is done,"" said Samour. ""That's what this whole process is about: Justice.""Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler wants Holmes put to death for the July 20, 2012, mass shooting in Aurora. He argues that life in prison is insufficient justice for the victims, survivors and their families.By pleading not guilty by reason of insanity, Holmes admitted he committed the shooting but claims he's legally not responsible for his actions. He's undergone at least two mental-health evaluations at the state mental hospital, but the results have remained secret.Holmes, then 24, was arrested at the scene by investigators who then discovered his apartment had been booby-trapped with explosives. His lawyers acknowledge Holmes, a former neuroscience doctorate student, was the lone shooter but say he was gripped by a psychotic episode.Legal analyst Scott Robinson said insanity-plea cases are rare, and it's even more unusual for a jury to find someone not guilty by reason of insanity.""It's a minuscule percentage ... yet the public perception is that people are getting off on the insanity plea all the time,"" said Robinson. ""It's actually a rare bird.""In December 2014 — just as jury summons went out — Holmes' parents issued a public statement begging prosecutors to drop the death penalty and give their son a plea deal that would see him locked up and treated.""We do not know how many victims of the theater shooting would like to see our son killed.

"The U.S. economy created the fewest number of jobs in more than five years in May, hurt by a strike by Verizon workers and a fall in goods producing employment, pointing to labor market weakness that could make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 38,000 jobs last month, the smallest gain since September 2010, the Labor Department said on Friday. Employers hired 59,000 fewer workers in March and April. The government said the month-long Verizon strike had depressed employment growth by 34,000 jobs.The goods producing sector, which includes mining and manufacturing, shed 36,000 jobs, the most since February 2010. Even without the Verizon strike, payrolls would have increased by a mere 72,000.The Verizon workers, who were considered unemployed because they did not receive a salary during the payrolls survey week, returned to their jobs on Wednesday. They are expected to boost June employment.The jobless rate fell three-tenths of a percentage point to 4.7 percent in May, the lowest since November 2007. The decrease in the unemployment rate was in part due to people dropping out of the labor force.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising 164,000 in May and the unemployment rate falling to 4.9 percent.Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said monthly gains of roughly 100,000 jobs are needed to keep up with growth in the work-age population. The U.S. central bank has signaled its intention to raise rates soon if job gains continued and economic data remained consistent with a pickup in growth in the second quarter.Yellen said last week that a rate increase would probably be appropriate in the ""coming months,"" if those conditions were met. Data on consumer spending, industrial production, goods exports and housing have suggested the economy is gathering speed after growth slowed to a 0.8 percent annualized rate in the first quarter.The Fed hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.There is still no sign of meaningful wage growth. Average hourly earnings rose five cents, or 0.2 percent, last month. That kept the year-on-year rise at 2.5 percent.Economists say wage growth of between 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent is needed to lift inflation to the Fed's 2.0 percent target. There are, however, signs that inflation is creeping higher as the dampening effects of the dollar's past rally and the oil price plunge dissipate.There was little change in other measures of labor market slack. A broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment held steady at 9.7 percent in May.The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell 0.2 percentage point to 62.6 percent.The gains in May were broadly weak, with the private sector adding only 25,000 jobs, the smallest since February 2010. Mining employment maintained its downward trend, shedding 10,000 positions. Mining payrolls have dropped by 207,000 since peaking in September 2014, with three-quarters of the losses in support activities.Manufacturing employment fell by 10,000 jobs. The Verizon labor dispute reduced information sector jobs by 34,000.Retail payrolls rose 11,400 after shedding jobs in April for the first time since December 2014. Temporary help jobs fell 21,000.",Reframe the text as an open letter to a public figure or organization mentioned in the story.,"I'm writing to you as a concerned citizen and observer of the U.S. labor market.The recent job creation numbers for May have raised concerns about the strength of the labor market and the potential impact on the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision-making process.

"Hillary Clinton didn't just take the vast majority of the available delegates in South Carolina on Saturday night. She also took away one of Bernie Sanders's strongest arguments — that he's the candidate who has the most working-class support.In Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders had done better than Clinton among voters in the lowest income brackets. That seemed to bolster his claim that his ""political revolution"" could energize millions of new low-income voters who typically don't turn out to vote.This argument, however, is much less tenable after tonight. Clinton did best among poor voters in South Carolina, taking 82 percent of those who earn under $30,000 on her way to a 37-point victory, according to exit polling by the New York Times.Here are the results by income, according to the Times:Of course, this discrepancy is largely driven by Clinton's huge 87-13 margin of victory over black voters. But that's the point — outside of states like Iowa and New Hampshire, many low-income and working-class voters aren't white. Unless Sanders is able to win working-class voters beyond the whitest electorates in the country, his revolution may be over almost as soon as it started.",Describe the events as if they were part of a historical epic tale.,"In the grand narrative of the ongoing political epic, the events that unfolded in South Carolina on Saturday night cast a pivotal chapter in the unfolding story. Clinton, the seasoned veteran, not only secured a substantial majority of the available delegates but also seized one of Sanders' most potent arguments - the assertion that he commands the most unwavering support among working-class Americans.In the early chapters of this tale, Sanders had etched his name in the hearts of many low-income voters"
"He's combative. He rejects compromise as ""the mushy middle."" He's not inclined to wait his turn. And he doesn't seem to mind annoying his Republican elders with tactics that critics see as destructive and short-sighted.So perhaps it's no surprise that little more than two years after he was sworn in to the Senate, the 44-year-old Texan on Monday became the first contender to officially announce his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. He skipped the one-step-at-a-time tradition of announcing an ""exploratory"" committee to declare flatly that he was in the race.""It's going to take a new generation of courageous conservatives to help make America great again,"" Cruz said in a 30-second video he posted on Twitter early Monday morning, followed by a speech at Liberty University, ""and I'm ready to stand with you to lead the fight.""He won't be lonely for long. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is slated to announce his candidacy in two weeks, likely followed in short order by yet another Republican senator, Marco Rubio of Florida. That's not to mention the governors (Wisconsin's Scott Walker, New Jersey's Chris Christie, Louisiana's Bobby Jindal), the former governors (Florida's Jeb Bush, Texas' Rick Perry, Arkansas' Mike Huckabee), the former senators (Pennsylvania's Rick Santorum) and the others who already are visiting Iowa and New Hampshire and hiring staffers for nascent campaigns.At his speech, a handful of students in a prominent front row sported red ""Stand With Rand"" sweatshirts.Cruz has been overshadowed in recent months by Bush, Walker and other contenders who have more muscular fundraising networks and stronger institutional support. In the Senate, he has been more of an agitator than a legislator. Arizona Sen. John McCain, the GOP's 2008 nominee, once called him a ""wacko bird.""That said, Cruz is worth watching.For one thing, the skills he honed as a college debater at Princeton — he was named U.S. National Speaker of the Year in 1992 — should serve him well in the series of crowded primary debates.For another, while his Tea Party credentials might be a mixed blessing in a general election, in the primaries they align him with the most energized forces in the Republican grass roots today. That helped him upset the establishment's favorite, lieutenant governor David Dewhurst, for the Republican Senate nomination in 2012.What's more, the locale Cruz chose to make Monday's announcement reflects his efforts to broaden his electoral base by wooing Christian conservatives, another key group in the GOP coalition. He spoke at the Lynchburg, Va., school founded by evangelical leader Jerry Falwell that describes itself on its website as the largest Christian university in the world.His speech had the ring of the religious testimony of an evangelical church. He declared his opposition to abortion and his support of traditional marriage. He emotionally described how his father's embrace of Jesus saved his parents' marriage. His father, Rafael, a pastor at a suburban Dallas church, fled Castro's Cuba in 1957.Cruz's Cuban-American heritage would be a selling point for the Republican Party as it tries to reach out to Hispanic voters, although his hardline stance on immigration could be a complication with those voters. And speaking of biography, he has an education that might surprise those inclined to dismiss him: He was graduated from Princeton and then from Harvard Law School, magna cum laude, before clerking at the Supreme Court for Chief Justice William Rehnquist.At one point, he urged his audience to ""take out your cellphones"" and text the word ""Constitution"" or ""Liberty"" — ""we're flexible,"" he said — to a number linked to his campaign.","Translate the article into a poetic format, capturing the essence and emotions of the story.","With combative spirit and a heart of fire,He stands tall, a force to admire.He rejects compromise, a mushy middle,And refuses to wait his turn to yield.With tactics that critics deem destructive and short-sighted,He doesn't mind annoying his elders, a fight.A new generation of"
"Israel has mounted what it terms an ""uphill battle"" against an agreement that might ease sanctions on the Iranians while leaving them with a nuclear infrastructure with bomb-making potential. Tehran says its nuclear program is peaceful.""This deal, as it appears to be emerging, bears out all of our fears, and even more than that,"" Netanyahu told his cabinet in Jerusalem as the United States, five other world powers and Iran worked toward a March 31 deadline in Lausanne, Switzerland.Noting advances made by Iranian-allied forces in Yemen and other Arab countries, Netanyahu accused the Islamic republic of trying to ""conquer the entire Middle East"" while moving toward nuclearization.""The Iran-Lausanne-Yemen axis is very dangerous to humanity, and must be stopped,"" he said.Netanyahu's campaigning against the nuclear negotiations crested on March 3 with his speech to the U.S. Congress at the invitation of its Republican speaker, John Boehner, that angered President Barack Obama and many fellow Democrats.The right-wing prime minister, who won a fourth term in a March 17 election, said on Sunday he had spoken to senior U.S. lawmakers from both parties ""and heard from them about the steadfast, strong and continuous bipartisan support for Israel"".Strategic Affairs Minister Yuval Steinitz, the Israeli official who has been spearheading efforts to lobby world powers against the Iran deal, voiced cautious hope that the negotiations would collapse as they have in the past.""We may still have a chance. We are not alone.

Still, as Jason Kelleher's map of the vote shows, there were some very pronounced regional differences:Anyone familiar with the basic sociology of gay rights in the West will be unsurprised to see that support for equality is largest in Dublin and down south in Cork, Ireland's second city.

"The race for the White House has become even more uncertain as federal investigators begin searching through newly discovered emails belonging to Hillary Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin.The emails were found on a laptop of Abedin's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, who is currently under investigation for allegedly sexting an underage girl.Officials have obtained a warrant to search those emails, but it is unlikely the review will be completed by Election Day.Meanwhile, the presidential race has tightened dramatically in the last several days.The gap was closing even before Friday's news that the FBI would reopen the investigation into Clinton's emails, but now the contest is virtually a dead heat.Even though the polls are close, Clinton still has an apparent advantage in the Electoral College. Consequently, both candidates are hitting key swing states where the election will likely be decided.Addressing supporters at a rally in Kent, Ohio, Monday, the former secretary of state sounded defiant about the email controversy.""I'm sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of wrongdoing with just days to go? That's a good question,"" Clinton said.""First of all, for those of you who are concerned about my use of personal email, I understand. As I said, I'm not making excuses, I understand and I regret it,"" she continued. ""They should look at them. And I'm sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year.

""The same failure she and other Democrats hung around the neck of the Bush 43 administration in post-Saddam Iraq.""Regarding Trump, ""when it comes to credibility problems, though, Donald Trump is in a league of his own,"" Gates said.""He has expressed support for building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico; for torturing suspected terrorists and killing their families; for [Vladimir] Putin’s dictatorial leadership and for Saddam Hussein’s nonexistent successes against terrorism.""Gates, who most-recently worked under Presidents George W.

"It's hard not to like Joe Biden. I've seen him speak in person several times, and his love for people and politics is downright infectious. I'm sad he announced Wednesday he is not running for president, because he's fun and he would have lit up the campaign.But I think he made the right decision.The path to winning the Democratic nomination certainly wasn't clear, let alone easy, and it's better for Biden to end his career at the high point of the vice presidency rather than try for the presidency once again and fail. And while Biden seems genuinely to relish campaigning, campaigns are getting less and less fun by the day. The truth is that a Biden candidacy would have been enjoyable for voters (and the media). But it probably wouldn't have been very enjoyable for Biden.More substantively, a Biden candidacy might simply have muddied the otherwise helpfully clear waters between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.Take the first Democratic debate, where Clinton tried to argue that her plan for how to deal with the ills and excesses of Wall Street was ""more comprehensive"" and ""tougher"" than Sanders'. Sanders' response? ""Well, that's not true.""On this issue, Sanders is right. He is a lifelong economic populist, to the point where he's not afraid to criticize the structural failings of capitalism and change the underlying rules of the game to make sure the economy helps poor people and working families. Clinton, on the other hand, has certainly embraced some of the rhetoric of populism in her latest campaign. But the extent to which it courses through her bones -- let alone her policies -- is questionable. In the middle of this debate would have been Biden. The vice president has more populist street cred from the get-go, especially rhetorically. I don't think I've ever heard Biden speak without mentioning his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. More importantly, despite a lofty career since then, he's always managed to maintain a straight shooter, ""Regular Joe"" style. But on policies, he's more closely aligned with Clinton than Sanders. Biden voted in favor of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act , which repealed part of the Glass-Steagall Act, opening the door to banks to engage in the wild risk-taking that crashed the economy. Biden sided with big banks in making it harder for Americans to reduce their amount of student debt. And Biden supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal (as Clinton did for a while before recently changing her view ). With a little more than a year until the presidential election, it's essential for Democratic voters -- and Americans in general -- to see a debate in the primaries in which conventional centrist economic policy is exposed and evaluated in light of a viable, populist alternative. Clinton and Sanders are having that very real and important debate. ""Regular Joe,"" who repeatedly promotes centrist policies that most help the country's elite, would have unhelpfully complicated things. ""I can die a happy man never having been president of the United States of America,"" Biden once told a reporter. ""But it doesn't mean I won't run."" Now, apparently he won't run. And while we should be grateful for his public service up until now, his decision is also a public service -- because the Democratic primary will run better without him.","If applicable, rewrite the article to include detailed scientific explanations or insights related to the topic.","I've seen him speak in person several times, and his genuine affection for people and politics is simply infectious.

"U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday’s unity march against terrorism.Kerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.The visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.The French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday’s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.Among roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.Kerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi’s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.In a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as “quibbling a little bit.” He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.“But that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,” he said.“And I don’t think the people of France have any doubts about America’s understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.”","Reimagine the article as a speculative fiction story, incorporating futuristic elements or technology.","The city of Paris pulsed with a somber yet resilient spirit on Sunday.

A New York Times/CBS Poll found Clinton's national lead at 7 percentage points. Clinton's interview with Fallon was her second appearance on ""The Tonight Show"" as a presidential candidate and came on the same night as the Fox Business Network hosted a Republican debate. The former secretary of state told Fallon that she usually doesn't watch the debates live because she loves ""to be able to fast forward"" through them. Fallon said the Republican candidates ""might say something bad about"" Clinton during the debate, suggesting she should ""have a drinking game where every time they say your name you do a shot."" ""I don't think I would make it past the first half hour,"" Clinton remarked. Fallon also goaded Clinton into a comment on Donald Trump by telling the former senator that the Republican front-runner has been talking about her on the campaign trail.

"While Donald Trump doubled down this week on his vow to make Mexico pay for his proposed southern border wall, his campaign is reported to be weighing options that don’t necessarily involve the seemingly far-fetched scenario of the Mexican government handing America a great, big check.LifeZette first reported that the Republican presidential nominee and his top advisers are looking at using assets seized from drug cartels and other traffickers. This reportedly could involve establishing a “joint border security fund” -- holding seized assets from crackdowns on both sides of the border – for border construction and maintenance.Trump, asked Thursday by Fox News about the report, did not deny the option is on the table.“There are many ways that they can pay for the wall,” Trump said, calling it a “negotiation.”But he again insisted, “The United States will not be paying for the wall. Mexico will be paying for the wall.”Breitbart News, whose chairman Stephen Bannon left to be Trump’s campaign CEO, also reported that cartel resources would be seized to fund the wall if Trump wins.Trump supporter, and former presidential primary rival, Ben Carson floated another option Thursday night.Speaking with Fox News, Carson said money saved from enforcing the border could be used – though he did not elaborate on what level of savings the federal government could expect, particularly when Trump is proposing spending more money on border security resources.“Recognize that a lot of money is going to be saved by enforcing our borders, by not, you know, giving various types of benefits to people who are here illegally,” Carson said. “That money is money that we otherwise would not have had and that can be applied to the wall and various other things. That’s I believe the spirit in which that comment is made. I don't think Mexico is going to write a check out and say here, pay for the wall.”Trump has not addressed such details on the stump.He declared in his immigration policy speech Wednesday night that, “Mexico will pay for the wall … they don’t know it yet, but they’re going to pay.”That came after Trump met with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City, and both men left the meeting battling over the payment issue. Trump said they didn’t discuss “payment,” while Pena Nieto said he made clear Mexico will not put up the money.According to The Wall Street Journal, Trump added the line about payment into his Phoenix speech, in response to Pena Nieto’s claims.If a Trump administration did pursue using cartel assets to fund a wall, it would take billions. Trump has estimated the wall could be built for as little as $8 billion, though other analyses have put the cost much higher.Estimates of Mexican cartel revenue vary drastically. The U.S. government estimated a decade ago that Mexican traffickers make nearly $14 billion on drug sales to the U.S.",Reframe the text as an open letter to a public figure or organization mentioned in the story.,"Dear Mr. Trump,I am writing to you in response to your recent remarks about the construction of the southern border wall and the potential for Mexico to pay for it.

"WASHINGTON -- A new research paper suggests Congress helped the economy to the tune of nearly 2 million jobs when lawmakers killed long-term unemployment benefits at the end of 2013.The working paper, by economists Marcus Hagedorn, Iourii Manovskii and Kurt Mitman, is a boon to congressional Republicans who insisted the benefits not be renewed. The Wall Street Journal editorial board trumpeted the findings and the House Ways and Means Committee, chaired by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), touted the paper on its blog.But while the study might help the GOP take credit for an improving economy, the story isn't so simple, as several other recent studies have found the long-term benefits weren't holding back workers.The new paper says the benefit cut led to 1.8 million additional jobs last year. ""Almost 1 million of these jobs were filled by workers from out of the labor force who would not have participated in the labor market had benefit extensions been reauthorized,"" the authors write.They reached their conclusion by comparing the 2014 employment growth of adjacent counties in separate states, since the federal unemployment insurance program that expired in December 2013 offered different durations of benefits depending on a state's unemployment rate. Using Labor Department data, the paper found that counties in states that lost out on more weeks of benefits saw higher job growth. In other words, they were better off without the benefits.The finding is contrary to predictions from the Obama administration and the Congressional Budget Office, which assumed keeping the extended unemployment compensation through 2014 would boost the economy. Other studies have found that the long-term jobless aid in place since 2008 didn't reduce the likelihood that laid off workers would take available jobs.Some commentators, both liberal and conservative, have taken issue with the paper's methodology. Using a different set of Labor Department data, Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research found a smaller increase in employment in states where the benefit cut was deeper.For some of the workers whose benefits ended that December, hardship ensued -- at least in the short term. Things got desperate for Charlie Walker of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, for instance, before he got a new job last fall. And Brian Krueger of Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, only got back to work in May 2014 after going on food stamps and nearly losing his house.

"Freddie Gray, whose death triggered Monday’s rioting in Baltimore, may have intentionally tried to injure himself in a police van, according to another prisoner in the vehicle, the Washington Post reported late Wednesday night.The Post said the unidentified prisoner, who was separated from Gray by a metal partition and could not see him, reportedly said he heard Gray “banging himself against the walls” and believed he “was intentionally trying to injure himself.The prisoner’s statements were contained in an investigative document obtained by the paper, which said it was unclear if there was any additional information to support the theory.Gray, who is black, was arrested April 12 after he ran from police. Officers held him down, handcuffed him and loaded him into the police van. While inside, he became irate and leg cuffs were put on him, police had said.

"President Obama defended his administration’s approach to the terror threat at a White House summit Wednesday, standing by claims that groups like the Islamic State do not represent Islam -- as well as assertions that job creation could help combat extremism.Obama, addressing the Washington audience on the second day of the summit, said the international community needs to address “grievances” that terrorists exploit, including economic and political issues.He stressed that poverty alone doesn’t cause terrorism, but “resentments fester” and extremism grows when millions of people are impoverished.“We do have to address the grievances that terrorists exploit including economic grievances,” he said.He also said no single religion was responsible for violence and terrorism, adding he wants to lift up the voice of tolerance in the United States and beyond.Obama’s address came as Republican lawmakers and others criticized the administration for declining to describe the threat as Islamic terrorism.State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf has also come under fire for suggesting several times this past week that more jobs could help address the terrorism crisis.On Tuesday, Rob O'Neill, former Navy SEAL Team 6 member who claims to have fired the shot that killed Usama bin Laden, told Fox News: ""They get paid to cut off heads -- to crucify children, to sell slaves and to cut off heads and I don't think that a change in career path is what's going to stop them.""Obama also called on Muslim leaders to “do more to discredit the notion that our nations are determined to suppress Islam, that there is an inherent clash in civilizations.”Obama acknowledged that some Muslim-Americans have concerns about working with the government, particularly law enforcement, and that their reluctance “is rooted in the objection to certain practices where Muslim-Americans feel they’ve been unfairly targeted.”He said it was important it make sure that abuses stop and are not repeated and that “we do not stigmatize entire communities.” He also said it was vital that “no one is profiled or put under a cloud of suspicion simply because of their faith.”Although Obama called for a renewed focus on preventing terrorists from recruiting and inspiring others, some thought his message seemed to miss the mark.“He was meandering, unfocused and weak,” said Richard Grenell, former U.S. spokesman at the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration and a Fox News contributor. “He was talking about isolating terrorists. He doesn’t understand the threat that we face… People are being burned in cages and he’s talking about more investments?”Sen.

"Muhammad will be back on the cover of the next edition of Charlie Hebdo, along with a message of forgiveness from surviving staffers at the French satirical magazine where 12 people were killed last week by a pair of Islamist brothers angered over the publication's penchant for showing images of the prophet.The decimated, but uncowed magazine upped its usual print run of 60,000 copies to 3 million for the magazine, due out Wednesday but released to the French newspaper Liberation. Fierce bidding on eBay had editions commanding as much as $500 following the outpouring of support for Charlie Hebdo, whose four top cartoonists were among the dozen killed. Editor-in-chief Gérard Biard said in a Tuesday radio interview the decision to run a cartoon if Muhammad holding a a “Je Suis Charlie” sign with the caption ""Tout est pardonne,"" or ""All is forgiven,"" and said the message was not that Muhammad was offering forgiveness, as some initially assumed.""It is we who forgive, not Muhammad,” he told France Info.Eight Charlie Hebdo staffers were killed in the attack, including the magazine's editorial director, Stephane Charbonnier, who drew under the name ""Charb.""Biard said tomorrow's issue is meant as both a memorial to fallen co-workers and proof that the magazine's mission of irreverence has not been compromised.""We needed to figure out how to continue laughing and making others laugh,"" he said.

It helps to be able to breathe a little.""The cover was created by cartoonist Renald Luzier, who draws under the name ""Luz,"" and created what Biard called a “moving but not sad” work.""Seen by Luz, Mohammed is much more sympathetic than even the Muslims see him. He's a 'nice little guy' as Luz, puts it. Those assassins killed people who draw nice little guys. We wanted to show the ludicrousness of it.”The New York Times reported late Monday that when Luz showed the drawing to staffers, he was greeted with laughter, applause and ironic shouts of ""Allahu akbar!""But one of Egypt's top Islamic authorities has warned Charlie Hebdo against publishing the cartoon.Egypt's Dar al-Ifta, which is in charge of issuing religious edicts, on Tuesday called the planned cover an ""unjustified provocation"" for millions of Muslims who respect and love their prophet.The statement said the cartoon is likely to cause a new wave of hatred in French and Western societies and called on the French government and others to reject ""the racist act"" by Charlie Hebdo.Charlie Hebdo's past caricatures of the Muslim prophet appear to have prompted last week's attacks, part of the worst terrorist rampage in France in decades. A total of 12 people were killed at the newspaper's offices by Said and Cherif Kouachi, French-born brothers who had trained with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.Some witnesses reported that the attackers at the paper's offices shouted ""We have avenged the prophet.""

"After the Paris attacks, Americans are divided on Obama’s plan to let in 10,000 Syrian refugees. The timing is good: Thanksgiving can shed light on how much the nation’s tradition of hospitality should influence this decision.Syria refugee Nedal Al-Hayk works as a fabricator in Warren, Mich. Several U.S. governors are threatening to halt efforts to allow Syrian refugees into their states in the aftermath of the coordinated attacks in Paris, though an immigration expert says they have no legal authority to do so.Just as Americans prepare to express their hospitality toward others during Thanksgiving, a national debate has erupted over another kind of hospitality: President Obama’s plan to welcome 10,000 Syrian refugees into the United States. After the Paris attacks, the plan has been widely challenged, not least by nearly half the US governors. They fear Islamic State terrorists might slip in as “sleepers” among the refugees. Others argue back that the US already rigorously vets all asylum seekers – for as long as two years.Might Thanksgiving, with all its traditions and meaning, shed some light on this debate?The practice of welcoming strangers into one’s home or community long precedes the first American thanksgiving, that autumn feast of 1621 when Pilgrims and native Americans expressed gratitude for either the harvest, each other, or God’s mercy (or all of the above). Hospitality is an ancient Middle East virtue, rooted in the traditions of desert tribes and deeply encoded in the three Abrahamic religions. In the scriptural book of Hebrews, we read: “Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.”Hospitality, like Thanksgiving, is a type of giving that treats others – rich or poor, stranger or family – as equals. In ancient days, this egalitarian focus was symbolized by the washing of a guest’s feet. Today it serves as a cornerstone for democracy. It is also the basis for the United Nations Refugee Convention, in which a majority of the world’s states have agreed to grant asylum to people deemed to be refugees.In the US, a thanksgiving day was not an official holiday until Lincoln made it one during the Civil War. The woman who championed it, Sarah Hale, wrote in 1864: “Let us each see to it that on this one day there shall be no family or individual, within the compass of our means to help, who shall not have some portion prepared, and some reason to join in the general Thanksgiving.”Granting permanent asylum in the US to a refugee, of course, is not the same as sharing a turkey dinner with a stranger.

"Mel Robbins is a CNN commentator, legal analyst, best-selling author and keynote speaker. In 2014, she was named outstanding news talk-radio host by the Gracie Awards. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author(CNN) If you understand nothing else about Donald Trump, understand this:He has a particular mindset we see all the time in business -- he's ""the disrupter.""The disrupter is someone whose entire ""brand"" is to break the mold, to turn the way we do things on its head. Amazon did this with retail, Uber did it with taxi services, Airbnb did it with travel, Tinder did it with dating, Slack is doing it with email, Spotify is doing it with music, peer-to-peer lending is changing banking.Disrupters don't fix what's broken because they don't innovate from inside the system. They break the mold, change our thinking about the mold and then hand us the new rules for how things work.Just look at the Big Five companies that drive the Internet economy -- all disrupters -- Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook. They were early movers, they played by their own rules. First they disrupted how we do business online, and now they define it. And they control it. Apple just reported its highest earnings ever. Looks like disruption is working.Today every taxi company in America could band together, and they still would not stop the power of Uber. That is because when you gain enough momentum, you dominate the market and the conversation.In his effect on everything from Fox News to the Koch Brothers to the newspapers that endorse candidates, Trump has disrupted every single aspect of the game of politics and created new rules -- and based on the polls, what he's done is working.And so far, most of the political establishment has been wrong about what this all means. They said he wouldn't last and now he's leading in the polls. They said he wouldn't disclose his financial information or quit reality TV and he did both. They said that every insulting, ridiculous, inaccurate and offensive thing that Trump has said would hurt him. No sign of this. They said no network would bow to his demands for shorter debates -- but they did.Who knows what will happen when the Republican National Committee has to officially pick its candidate for president, but -- holy cow -- it sure will be interesting to watch. And who will we be watching? Trump.We can call Trump the carnival barker or the political side show, but discrediting the one who is wielding new power is what we do when we lose control of the negotiation. It's not politics, it's business -- as usual. This is why Trump understands that he can ignore it.He also understands something powerful: leverage. He is above Fox News, because he IS the news. And he knows that what he says AND where he goes is the story and therefore it is the business asset. So he is keeping control of that asset.The establishment can't play by the disrupter's rules, because the rules are designed to destroy it.The Republican establishment has already lost. Trump will be the party's next nominee no matter how many times he says he won't call Megyn Kelly a bimbo. It doesn't matter how many backroom meetings the Koch brothers organize or what Reince Priebus does to rally RNC delegates. It's over.The newspaper endorsements are also irrelevant, as are the fringe politicians and reality stars who are lining up to endorse Trump. They are all too late.The only thing that can beat Donald Trump now is the one thing he doesn't control: Americans who don't want his services as president of the United States.And the only way they will make a difference if there are enough of them -- enough liberals, Democrats, independents, and yes, even some Republicans and conservatives -- who can appreciate the appeal of a disrupter, but don't want one to lead the country.","Transform the text into a trivia quiz, testing knowledge on facts or details mentioned in the story.",**Trivia Quiz****1.

"Today the White House will hold the annual Easter egg roll. Kids will roll their eggs along the lawn, hunt for eggs, and enjoy other fun activities. It's a benign, heartwarming event.So where did this lovable tradition come from? It all started when Congress made kids get off its lawn.The Easter egg roll goes back a long time — some say Dolley Madison began the tradition, though that's probably just legend. There are reports of various egg rolls occurring throughout the mid-1800s, but by the 1870s, there weren't a lot of places for kids to have fun in Washington, DC. The city was very much under construction — the Washington Monument had been left half-finished for 23 years — and contained a lot of dirt and mud.That led a lot of kids to play near Capitol Hill. The only problem? Their presence uprooted some of the tender grass that was just starting to grow near the Capitol Building. The annual Easter egg rolls they held there upset the national landscaping.So on April 21, 1876, Congress passed the Turf Protection Law, which banned Easter egg rolls on Capitol Hill. In 1877, bad weather kept the Easter egg roll from happening, and 1878 didn't look much better. In the days leading up to Easter, the Washington Post warned kids not to roll their eggs on the Capitol's lawn or they'd encounter the large Capitol police force:Things looked bleak for the Easter tradition until the president stepped in.At some point in April 1878, a child from the neighborhood saw President Hayes on a stroll. He asked Hayes when he'd allow kids to roll eggs on his new White House lawn. Hayes looked into it and told the guards that if any kids showed up to roll eggs on the White House lawn, it was fine.It's tempting to interpret the egg roll as a political battle. After all, the leader behind the Turf Protection Law, William Holman, was a Democrat, and that party regularly called Hayes ""Rutherfraud"" because of his disputed election in 1876. So perhaps Hayes was just trying to show up Democrats?More likely, it was that the president wanted kids to have fun. Nancy Kleinhenz is the communications manager at the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center, where they've been re-creating the egg roll for years. She says it wasn't politics but fatherly instincts that inspired Hayes to save the day. After all, Hayes had two children who were still young: Scott and Fanny, who were 10 and seven. ""Politics wasn't a factor,"" Kleinhenz says. ""He was a dad."" Since then, the Easter Egg Roll has become a tradition at the White House, with only brief pauses during wartime.The Easter egg roll probably isn't a story about partisan battles. But in Washington, everything becomes political when federal resources are involved — and that includes which lawn gets trampled by children playing with eggs.","Design a virtual reality experience concept, where users can explore the story's settings.","It's a well-written story that clearly explains the origins of the tradition and its evolution over time.

"WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday threw out an appeals court decision that went against the University of Notre Dame over its religious objections to the Obamacare health law's contraception requirement.The justices asked the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider its decision in favor of the Obama administration in light of the June 2014 Supreme Court ruling that allowed closely held corporations to seek exemptions from the provision.The court's action means the February 2014 appeals court ruling that denied the South Bend, Indiana-based Roman Catholic university an injunction against the requirement has been wiped out.The 2010 Affordable Care Act, known widely as Obamacare, requires employers to provide health insurance policies that cover preventive services for women including access to contraception and sterilization.In the 2014 ruling, the high court said that Hobby Lobby Stores Ltd could, on religious grounds, seek exemptions from the contraception provision.Days later, in a case similar to the Notre Dame dispute, the Supreme Court allowed a college in Illinois a temporary exemption while litigation continues.Catholic groups say they should not have to pay for or facilitate access to contraception or abortion because of religious objections.But courts that have considered the issue since then have found that a compromise aimed at nonprofits with religious affiliations, issued in 2013 and amended in August 2014, did not impose a substantial burden on the plaintiffs' religious beliefs. Religious rights are protected under a law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.The Notre Dame case was the only appeals court decision on that issue that pre-dated the Hobby Lobby ruling.The compromise allows the groups to certify they are opting out, which then forces insurers to pick up the tab.Notre Dame says the certification process still essentially forces the groups to authorize the coverage for its employees, even if they are not technically paying for it. Religious institutions are exempt from the contraception coverage requirement.The case is Notre Dame v. Burwell, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-392.

The church has decided to support anti-discrimination legislation for gays and lesbians in the realm of housing and employment.

One example, a doctor who refuses to artificially inseminate a lesbian couple. Utah is facing two bills that protections for each group. Political watchers in the state have noted that both measures would be likely to pass if the LDS Church got behind it.“When religious people are publicly intimidated, retaliated against, forced from employment or made to suffer personal loss because they have raised their voice in the public square, donated to a cause, or participated in an election, our democracy is the loser,” said Elder Dallin Oaks, a member of the church’s Quorum of Twelve Apostles. “Such tactics are every bit as wrong as denying access to employment, housing, or public services because of race or gender.”However, this month, the church was in hot water for planning to excommunicate a prominent critic of its same-sex marriage stance for the apostasy.","Frame as an investigative report, digging deeper into the article's implications.","This move has sparked a range of reactions, highlighting the complex and sensitive nature of the issue.The church's decision to back such legislation underscores its commitment to inclusivity and equality.

Barry Morris, spokesman for the Marine Corps Special Operations Command at Camp Lejeune.Like the Army's Green Berets and the Navy's SEALs, these Marines were highly skilled unconventional warriors, trained to endure grueling conditions and sensitive assignments on land and at sea, from seizing ships to special reconnaissance missions and direct action inside hostile territory.The helicopter was part of a nighttime training mission Tuesday at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. There was dense fog in the area at the time of the crash but officials have not said what caused the helicopter to go down.Fog had reduced visibility to less than two miles at the time, according to the National Weather Service. Another helicopter participating in the exercise turned back because of the bad weather before the other Black Hawk crashed, authorities said.Despite the human remains washing ashore, the military still called it a rescue mission Wednesday, said Sara Vidoni, a spokeswoman for Eglin Air Force Base, outside Pensacola.The fog remained so heavy Wednesday that search boats just offshore could be heard but not seen, blasting horns as their crews peered into the choppy water. It finally began to lift in the afternoon, enabling a helicopter to slowly survey the water.About a dozen airmen wearing fatigues walked shoulder-to-shoulder down the beach, scanning the sand, while civilian rescue crews and searchers with dogs joined the effort.The Coast Guard said debris was first spotted about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, and that the search area expanded to a 17-mile stretch of the narrow sound separating Santa Rosa Island from the Florida Panhandle mainland.The Marines were part of a special operations group based in Camp Lejeune. They had arrived Sunday for a week of training.None were immediately identified, so that families could be told first.The helicopter that crashed had joined the training from an airport in nearby Destin.

"PARIS, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Police arrested a dozen people suspected of helping the Islamist militant gunmen in last week's Paris killings, the city prosecutor's office said on Friday as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived for talks.The arrests came after Belgian police killed two men who fired on them during one of about a dozen raids on Thursday against an Islamist group and German police said they had arrested two people following a raid on 11 properties linked to radical Salafists.Centered on southern Paris suburbs including the Montrouge area where a young policewoman was killed in the attacks, the arrests were for suspected ""logistical support"" for the shootings, an official said.Seventeen victims and the three attackers died in three days of violence in Paris last week that began with an assault on the offices of satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo.Paris's Gare de l'Est train station was evacuated at 8:00 a.m. local time (0700 GMT) after an alert but reopened about an hour later, the SNCF state railway said, without giving further details.Kerry had said on Thursday that his visit to France was to give a ""big hug"" to Paris. Senior U.S. officials were absent from a commemoration march held in Paris on Sunday attended by dozens of world leaders. President Barack Obama's administration conceded that was an omission.""I think you know that you have the full and heartfelt condolences of the American people and I know you know that we share the pain and the horror of everything that you went through,"" Kerry told Hollande on Friday.""Together we need to find the right responses and this is the purpose of our meeting here today, beyond the friendship,"" he said.Investigators are still poring over the complex chain of events that led to three French nationals - two brothers with Algerian roots and a third of African extraction - perpetrating the worst attacks on French soil for decades.Belgian investigators said they are trying to establish if a man detained in the city of Charleroi on suspicion of arms trafficking had any links with Amedy Coulibaly, the gunman who killed four Jews at a kosher supermarket in Paris last week.His lawyer Michel Bouchat told French media the man was not an associate of Coulibaly and had merely sold him a car. The man in question already contacted police on Tuesday to say he had had contacts with Hayat Boumedienne, the partner of Coulibaly now believed to be in Syria.

Williams is from the St. Louis area and had been on probation for receiving stolen property.Williams had been involved in protests on the evening that the shooting occurred and had ""acknowledged"" firing shots, according to McCulloch. McCulloch said that Williams, who is African-American, may have been firing at someone other than the police.""We don't know him,"" said Tony Rice, the founder of Ground Level Support, who has been protesting since AugustAfter naming three young male protesters who were regularly at the demonstrations, Rice told HuffPost, ""I don't think there is a male 20-years-old that regularly protest outside of them.""""I think I can speak for the protester community in saying we don't know him,"" said Rice.After the press conference, press swarmed Alicia Street when she helped source the first picture of Williams. Street, 29, has been actively involved in protest since August as well and says she was unfamiliar with Williams as well.""I have never seen him at a protest. I cannot recall that I even seen him that night. We know a lot of people out there, we really do.

One of the officers was shot in the face and the other was shot in the shoulder, but both survived the attack.Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement on Sunday that the arrest was a testament to good collaboration between federal and local authorities.“This arrest sends a clear message that acts of violence against our law enforcement personnel will never be tolerated. The swiftness of this action is a credit to the significant cooperation between federal authorities and the St. Louis County Police Department,"" Holder said.

"A couple of weeks ago in this space I pushed back against assertions by FiveThirtyEight number-cruncher Harry Enten that Gary Johnson's polls have been ""trending downwards,"" indicating that ""voters may be moving away from third-party options."" Well, today Enten is back with an interesting piece headlined ""Gary Johnson Isn't Fading.""While noting what we have been warning you about here for years—third-party candidates typically see their crest of polling support halved by Election Day, according to Gallup—Enten explains that Johnson's numbers have so far not followed this pattern. In fact, the Libertarian may have already weathered the most difficult part of the calendar: ""Most third-party candidates didn't lose that much support between late summer and Election Day,"" Enten writes. ""Besides John Anderson in 1980, no candidate ended up finishing more than 3 percentage points below where they were polling in late August. The average drop-off is about 2 percentage points.""So how does Johnson's 9 percent stack up at this point in the campaign against other third-party candidates since World War II? According to numbers compiled by Enten here, fourth place, behind Ross Perot in 1992 (20 percent then, finished at 19), George Wallace in '68 (17/14), and Anderson in '80 (14/7). He's just a tick above Perot in '96 (8/8), behind which nobody comes close (sorry, Libertarians!). Because of his staying power, FiveThirtyEight has adjusted its predictions for Johnson's final vote upward, to 7.1 percent.But what about the debates, I hear you ask. Well, while #TeamGov and its supporters are touting this new Qunnipiac poll showing 62 percent of Americans think the Libertarian should be in next month's televised showdown, that and a glass of water will get you a drink. As Enten notes, Johnson may not be fading, but he's also not particularly rising, either, and there's a whole lotta real estate between 9 and the required 15 percent. The L.P. ticket did reach a new high this week in the Quinnipiac poll (10 percent, up from 8 percent in June), and tied previous highs in polls by NBC News/Survey Monkey (11 percent), Rasmussen Reports (9 percent), and Reuters/Ipsos (7 percent), but at this advanced date, ties go to the loser.Looking for a glimmer of hope? Here's one intriguing gap in the numerical record. Of the Commission on Presidential Debates' determinative Big Five polls, in which Johnson has been averaging 10 percent instead of 9, none of them have produced results in the last three weeks.

"Protesters in Arizona briefly blocked access to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s rally Saturday morning in Arizona, kicking off a full day of campaign events in the border state, which holds key primaries Tuesday.The protesters blocked a highway leading to Trump’s outdoor rally in Fountain Hills, Arizona, near Scottsdale, before sheriff's deputies removed them and towed their vehicles.“We’re not going to let demonstrators intimidate this forum and this sheriff. Now we’re going to have a nice, nice rally for Donald Trump,” said Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who led the effort to remove the demonstrators and who has endorsed the GOP front-runner.Arizona has long been ground-zero for the politically-charged illegal immigration debate, with roughly 368 miles of border with Mexico and more border fence than any other state.Roughly 30 percent of Arizona’s population is Hispanic. And in 2010, the state passed one of the strictest anti-immigration laws in American history.“So much crime and drugs passing through the border. You know what? We’re going to build a wall, and we’re going to stop it,” Trump said at the rally, returning to his early and oft-repeated campaign promise to build a wall along the southern border and have Mexico pay for it.Arpaio – the self-described “America’s toughest sheriff” – said at least 10,000 people were kept waiting in the Arizona heat for about an hour as a result of the roadblock, which resulted in three arrests.Trump supporters and protesters exchanged words at the rally, but there were no initial reports of physical violence.Trump, who early in his campaign visited the border, leads the GOP field in Arizona with 34 percent of the vote, followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 21 percent and Ohio Gov. John Kasich at 13 percent.Trump held a larger rally later Saturday at the Phoenix Convention Center.Trump said protesters at his rally are ""taking away our First Amendment rights"" and vowed to take the country back if he's elected president.He called one protester at his Phoenix rally, who wore the Klu Klux Klan hood, ""disgusting."" Another group, carrying a ""Black Lives Matter"" sign were also kicked out.The rallies and protest follow a local border patrol union of Friday supporting Trump.Local 2544 said Trump asked for the endorsement and that officials responded by saying he is the only 2016 White House candidate to “publicly expressed his support” of the Border Patrol’s mission and it agents and that he has been “an outspoken candidate” on the need for a secure border.However, Art Del Cueto, president of the Tucson-based union, made clear that he would adhere to the larger National Border Patrol Council’s practice of not endorsing presidential candidates.The Supreme Court later upheld the most controversial part of Arizona’s 2010 law -- commonly referred to S.B. 1070 and that allows police to try to determine the immigration status of anybody arrested or detained if they have “reasonable suspicion” the suspect is in the U.S. illegally.However, the law also sparked widespread opposition including businesses threatening to leave the state.Trump and Cruz essentially call for those living illegally in the United States to return to their home country, while Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders want to allow them to stay.Several thousand miles away in New York, demonstrators also took to the streets to protest the Republican presidential hopeful.The protesters gathered Saturday in Manhattan's Columbus Circle, across from Central Park, with a heavy police presence. Demonstrators chanted: ""Donald Trump, go away, racist, sexist, anti-gay.""They marched across south Central Park to Trump Tower, the Fifth Avenue skyscraper where Trump lives. Then they marched back to Columbus Circle for a rally.","Adapt the article to emphasize its relevance and impact on the global stage, highlighting international implications.","The protests blocked a highway leading to Trump’s outdoor rally in Fountain Hills, Arizona, near Scottsdale, before sheriff's deputies removed them and towed their vehicles.

"The jury in the Jodi Arias case tasked with deciding whether she should be sentenced to life in prison or death for killing her lover nearly seven years ago was unable to agree on terms of sentencing Thursday, removing the possibility of a death sentence.The judge declared a mistrial and will sentence Arias to either life in prison or a life term with the possibility of release after 25 years.It marked the second time a jury has deadlocked on her punishment -- a disappointment for prosecutors who argued for the death penalty during the nearly seven-year legal battle against Arias.Arias was convicted of murder in 2013 after a lengthy trial that became a sensation with its tawdry revelations about her relationship with victim Travis Alexander.The victim's sister, Samantha Alexander, sobbed in court while the decision was announced.The jurors deliberated for 26.5 hours over a five-day span. Earlier this week, Arias' attorneys said jurors were at an impasse, but the judge denied a mistrial request. A verdict does not rule out the possibility of a hung jury.Arias stabbed and slashed Alexander nearly 30 times, slit his throat so deeply that she nearly decapitated him, and shot him in the forehead. She left his body in his shower at his suburban Phoenix home where friends found him about five days later.She initially denied having anything to do with the killing. She later admitted that she killed Alexander but claimed it was self-defense after he attacked her.

"Speaking from Hiroshima, the site of the first war-time atomic weapon detonation, President Obama on Friday called for the pursuit of ""a world without nuclear weapons.""Only a few days prior, his Department of Defense published new data revealing that the government Obama oversees -- a government which manages the second-largest nuclear stockpile in the world -- had dismantled fewer of its nuclear devices than in any year since at least 1980.Every year, the Department of Defense declassifies data on the size of the country's nuclear stockpile and the number of warheads dismantled. Its most recent data, released this week, shows that the U.S. stockpile numbered 4,571 at the end of 2015, about 15 percent of its size at its peak during the Cold War in 1967. The number of weapons dismantled was 109, the lowest figure since at least 1980.In 1945, the size of the stockpile matched the number of weapons deployed -- two. The biggest reductions came in the early 1990s during the administration of George H.W. Bush and, a decade later, during his son's. At the end of 2008, the stockpile numbered 5,273; over the course of Obama's two terms, it has dropped to 4,571.It is, of course, easier to reduce the size of a stockpile when it is much larger. As a fraction of the total weapon count, Obama has sliced the total by a bit more than one-tenth -- 13 percent. But the Federation of American Scientists is still critical of Obama's progress in this regard. That 13 percent is ""the smallest reduction of the stockpile achieved by any previous post-Cold War administration;"" the 109 dismantlings last year continues ""a trendline of fewer and fewer warheads dismantled"" under Obama. The FAS notes that there are reasons outside of the administration's control for the lower number last year -- but also that political pressure discourages a push for reduction.Why does the size of our stockpile matter? As data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows, the United States still controls about half of the weapons controlled by recognized nuclear states.","Reframe the text as a pilot's log, navigating through the events or ideas as if on a journey.","The sky was clear and the wind was calm as I took off from the bustling streets of Hiroshima, a city etched in history by the devastating detonation of the first war-time atomic weapon.

"U.S. Flag Flies Over Embassy In Cuba For First Time In 54 YearsUpdated at 11:25 a.m. ETSecretary of State John Kerry presided over a ceremony reopening the U.S. Embassy in Havana, including a flag-raising ceremony — an event that will mark the first time the Stars and Stripes have flown over a diplomatic compound there in 54 years.Kerry, speaking before assembled dignitaries, remembered the strained history of U.S.-Cuba relations, including the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, when the Soviet Union was discovered to be siting nuclear rockets on the island nation.""I was a student then and I could still remember the taut faces of our leaders,"" he said. ""We were unsettled and uncertain about our future because we didn't know when we went to bed what we would find when we woke up.""The people of Cuba ""would be best served by a genuine democracy,"" he said, but added that it was ""unrealistic"" to expect Cuba to make such a transition anytime soon. ""Cuba's future is for Cubans to shape,"" he said.Speaking in Spanish, Kerry said the ceremony showed that the U.S. and Cuba ""are no longer enemies, but neighbors.""Three U.S. Marines who lowered the flag at the embassy in 1961, when Havana and Washington severed diplomatic ties, accompanied Kerry to the ceremony and presented the new flag to Marines to hoist once again to the strains of the Star Spangled Banner.The Washington Post reports that the three Marines, retired Master Gunnery Sgt. Jim Tracy and then-Lance Cpl. Larry C. Morris and then-Cpl. F.W. Mike East, all now in their 70s, ""will appear in Havana alongside Secretary of State John F. Kerry and raise the flag again.

"Federal laws already allow people across the country the option to register to vote at the DMV. But Oregon and California's laws are pioneering because they do it automatically.It's hard to overstate how novel this concept is for the US. Throughout much of United States history, governments frequently put up barriers aimed at preventing people from voting, such as property ownership requirements, poll taxes, or literacy tests.Gradually, many of these barriers have fallen to make it easier for people to register. However, many states, including California, still close off registration weeks to a month before an election — an artificial obstacle that can prevent perfectly qualified people from voting if they simply miss a deadline.These new proposals remove those obstacles. Oregon's law will register all adult citizens in the DMV's database, while California's law will be implemented more gradually, as people get or renew their licenses or state IDs, or change their addresses. But both make it the government's responsibility to ensure that all eligible voters are registered.So it's a big deal that governments are now trying to make it easier and easier to vote, rather than more difficult. Matt Yglesias has argued for going even further and enshrining an affirmative right to vote in our Constitution — read his case here.In both California and Oregon, Republicans opposed these proposals, but generally didn't argue against the principle of easing registration. Instead, the criticisms have fallen along two main lines.First, critics have argued that since voter registration data is more publicly accessible than DMV information, automatically adding voters to the rolls could pose privacy concerns. However, supporters respond that people can always opt out.Second, some Republicans have cited concerns about voter fraud — usually about potential registration of unauthorized immigrants. But while California began issuing driver's licenses to unauthorized immigrants this year, these licenses are distinctively marked, and people with them would not be registered to vote automatically. And Oregon requires proof of citizenship for all driver's license applicants.Meanwhile, national Democrats are increasingly adopting mandatory voter registration as a major cause. In a speech on voting rights this June, Hillary Clinton called on all states to automatically register citizens to vote when they turn 18, unless they choose to opt out. And legislators in 15 other states have introduced bills similar to Oregon's new law — the Brennan Center is tracking them here.","Develop as an email newsletter to clients, highlighting key points and implications.","**Key points:*** **Federal law:** Allows for nationwide voter registration at the DMV.* **Oregon and California:** Pioneering automatic voter registration.* **Barriers to voting:** Property ownership requirements, poll taxes, and literacy tests have fallen.* **New proposals:** Remove obstacles to voting, including missed deadlines.* **Republican opposition:** Privacy"
"Today the White House will hold the annual Easter egg roll. Kids will roll their eggs along the lawn, hunt for eggs, and enjoy other fun activities. It's a benign, heartwarming event.So where did this lovable tradition come from? It all started when Congress made kids get off its lawn.The Easter egg roll goes back a long time — some say Dolley Madison began the tradition, though that's probably just legend. There are reports of various egg rolls occurring throughout the mid-1800s, but by the 1870s, there weren't a lot of places for kids to have fun in Washington, DC. The city was very much under construction — the Washington Monument had been left half-finished for 23 years — and contained a lot of dirt and mud.That led a lot of kids to play near Capitol Hill. The only problem? Their presence uprooted some of the tender grass that was just starting to grow near the Capitol Building. The annual Easter egg rolls they held there upset the national landscaping.So on April 21, 1876, Congress passed the Turf Protection Law, which banned Easter egg rolls on Capitol Hill. In 1877, bad weather kept the Easter egg roll from happening, and 1878 didn't look much better. In the days leading up to Easter, the Washington Post warned kids not to roll their eggs on the Capitol's lawn or they'd encounter the large Capitol police force:Things looked bleak for the Easter tradition until the president stepped in.At some point in April 1878, a child from the neighborhood saw President Hayes on a stroll. He asked Hayes when he'd allow kids to roll eggs on his new White House lawn. Hayes looked into it and told the guards that if any kids showed up to roll eggs on the White House lawn, it was fine.It's tempting to interpret the egg roll as a political battle. After all, the leader behind the Turf Protection Law, William Holman, was a Democrat, and that party regularly called Hayes ""Rutherfraud"" because of his disputed election in 1876. So perhaps Hayes was just trying to show up Democrats?More likely, it was that the president wanted kids to have fun. Nancy Kleinhenz is the communications manager at the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center, where they've been re-creating the egg roll for years. She says it wasn't politics but fatherly instincts that inspired Hayes to save the day. After all, Hayes had two children who were still young: Scott and Fanny, who were 10 and seven. ""Politics wasn't a factor,"" Kleinhenz says. ""He was a dad."" Since then, the Easter Egg Roll has become a tradition at the White House, with only brief pauses during wartime.The Easter egg roll probably isn't a story about partisan battles. But in Washington, everything becomes political when federal resources are involved — and that includes which lawn gets trampled by children playing with eggs.","Convert the article into a comedy sketch, finding humor in the situations or characters involved.",The White House Easter Egg Roll is a comedic sketch about a tradition gone awry.**Characters:*** The President of the United States* A child from the neighborhood* William Holman (a Democrat)* Nancy Kleinhenz (communications manager at the Rutherford B.

"There were several reports this month, based on former and current aides, that Mitt Romney is actively weighing another presidential run. The biggest sign yet comes from a recent interview with The New York Times, where the former 2012 Republican nominee offered a less than Shermanesque response to the million-dollar question.This was the obvious opening for me to ask if there was a chance. Romney's response was decidedly meta — ""I have nothing to add to the story"" -- but he then fell into the practiced political parlance of nondenial. ""We've got a lot of people looking at the race,"" he said. ""We'll see what happens.""Buoyed by good poll numbers and a wide-open prospective Republican field, Romney went farther than his ""circumstances can change"" reply in August, and certainly miles forward from the, ""Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no,"" answer in January.If he does throw his hat into the ring for a third time, the former governor of Massachusetts told the Times that he would employ a cameraman -- essentially his own tracker -- to follow him around in order to guard against statements that derailed his 2012 campaign. ""I want to be reminded that this is not off the cuff,"" Romney said.Romney said the tactic could potentially prevent another ""47 percent"" incident, which by his telling, was nothing more than a problem of setting.""My mistake was that I was speaking in a way that reflected back to the man,"" Romney said.

"After the Paris attacks, Americans are divided on Obama’s plan to let in 10,000 Syrian refugees. The timing is good: Thanksgiving can shed light on how much the nation’s tradition of hospitality should influence this decision.Syria refugee Nedal Al-Hayk works as a fabricator in Warren, Mich. Several U.S. governors are threatening to halt efforts to allow Syrian refugees into their states in the aftermath of the coordinated attacks in Paris, though an immigration expert says they have no legal authority to do so.Just as Americans prepare to express their hospitality toward others during Thanksgiving, a national debate has erupted over another kind of hospitality: President Obama’s plan to welcome 10,000 Syrian refugees into the United States. After the Paris attacks, the plan has been widely challenged, not least by nearly half the US governors. They fear Islamic State terrorists might slip in as “sleepers” among the refugees. Others argue back that the US already rigorously vets all asylum seekers – for as long as two years.Might Thanksgiving, with all its traditions and meaning, shed some light on this debate?The practice of welcoming strangers into one’s home or community long precedes the first American thanksgiving, that autumn feast of 1621 when Pilgrims and native Americans expressed gratitude for either the harvest, each other, or God’s mercy (or all of the above). Hospitality is an ancient Middle East virtue, rooted in the traditions of desert tribes and deeply encoded in the three Abrahamic religions. In the scriptural book of Hebrews, we read: “Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.”Hospitality, like Thanksgiving, is a type of giving that treats others – rich or poor, stranger or family – as equals. In ancient days, this egalitarian focus was symbolized by the washing of a guest’s feet. Today it serves as a cornerstone for democracy. It is also the basis for the United Nations Refugee Convention, in which a majority of the world’s states have agreed to grant asylum to people deemed to be refugees.In the US, a thanksgiving day was not an official holiday until Lincoln made it one during the Civil War. The woman who championed it, Sarah Hale, wrote in 1864: “Let us each see to it that on this one day there shall be no family or individual, within the compass of our means to help, who shall not have some portion prepared, and some reason to join in the general Thanksgiving.”Granting permanent asylum in the US to a refugee, of course, is not the same as sharing a turkey dinner with a stranger. Today’s modern nation-states are careful about who crosses their borders, either to prevent problems or to enhance their society. But with 1 in every 122 people now either a refugee, internally displaced, or seeking asylum, the need for hospitality is great. And in hospitality a nation can find its greatness.","Design a virtual reality experience concept, where users can explore the story's settings.","The experience immerses users in a virtual world where they can explore the story's settings and engage with characters.**The virtual reality experience concept is as follows:****Setting:** The experience takes place in various settings, including Warren, Michigan, where the refugee Nedal Al-Hayk works as a fabricator, and the United States"
"U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday’s unity march against terrorism.Kerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.The visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.The French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday’s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.Among roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.Kerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi’s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.In a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as “quibbling a little bit.” He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.“But that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,” he said.“And I don’t think the people of France have any doubts about America’s understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.”",Describe the events as if they were part of a historical epic tale.,"U.S. Secretary of State John F.

"PARIS, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Police arrested a dozen people suspected of helping the Islamist militant gunmen in last week's Paris killings, the city prosecutor's office said on Friday as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived for talks.The arrests came after Belgian police killed two men who fired on them during one of about a dozen raids on Thursday against an Islamist group and German police said they had arrested two people following a raid on 11 properties linked to radical Salafists.Centered on southern Paris suburbs including the Montrouge area where a young policewoman was killed in the attacks, the arrests were for suspected ""logistical support"" for the shootings, an official said.Seventeen victims and the three attackers died in three days of violence in Paris last week that began with an assault on the offices of satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo.Paris's Gare de l'Est train station was evacuated at 8:00 a.m. local time (0700 GMT) after an alert but reopened about an hour later, the SNCF state railway said, without giving further details.Kerry had said on Thursday that his visit to France was to give a ""big hug"" to Paris. Senior U.S. officials were absent from a commemoration march held in Paris on Sunday attended by dozens of world leaders. President Barack Obama's administration conceded that was an omission.""I think you know that you have the full and heartfelt condolences of the American people and I know you know that we share the pain and the horror of everything that you went through,"" Kerry told Hollande on Friday.""Together we need to find the right responses and this is the purpose of our meeting here today, beyond the friendship,"" he said.Investigators are still poring over the complex chain of events that led to three French nationals - two brothers with Algerian roots and a third of African extraction - perpetrating the worst attacks on French soil for decades.Belgian investigators said they are trying to establish if a man detained in the city of Charleroi on suspicion of arms trafficking had any links with Amedy Coulibaly, the gunman who killed four Jews at a kosher supermarket in Paris last week.His lawyer Michel Bouchat told French media the man was not an associate of Coulibaly and had merely sold him a car. The man in question already contacted police on Tuesday to say he had had contacts with Hayat Boumedienne, the partner of Coulibaly now believed to be in Syria.

"WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - Republican senators warned Iran on Monday that any nuclear deal made with U.S. President Barack Obama could last only as long as he remains in office, in an unusual intervention into U.S. foreign policy-making.The letter, signed by 47 U.S. senators, says Congress plays a role in ratifying international agreements and points out that Obama will leave office in January 2017, while many in Congress will remain in Washington long after that.""We will consider any agreement regarding your nuclear-weapons program that is not approved by the Congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei,"" the letter read.""The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of an agreement at any time,"" it read.The letter, first reported by Bloomberg News, followed a speech to a joint meeting of Congress last week by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who warned that the United States was negotiating a ""bad deal"" with Tehran.It comes as world powers have been negotiating with Iran to try to reach some form of understanding by the end of March before a final deal in June that could ease crippling sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy.The U.S. Constitution divides foreign policy powers between the president and Congress. The executive branch is responsible for negotiating international agreements and lawmakers rarely intervene directly with the leaders of another nation while the president's administration is negotiating a pact.Republicans want any U.S. nuclear agreement with Iran to be approved by Congress. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who signed the letter released on Monday, agreed to postpone a vote on a bill requiring Obama to submit any deal for congressional approval amid outcry from Democrats.Along with McConnell, Republican signers include Tom Cotton, Orrin Hatch, John Cornyn, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, John Thune and Mark Kirk. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, two possible 2016 presidential contenders, also signed.

"Obama Looking For Justice Who Will 'Interpret' The Law, Not 'Make' ItThe legal world has a new blogger: former constitutional law professor and current President Barack Obama.The president took to SCOTUSblog, the leading online chronicle of the Supreme Court, on Wednesday to offer some ""spoiler-free insights"" into what he is seeking in a justice to replace the late Antonin Scalia.Aside from ""mastery of the law,"" Obama said he wants to choose a nominee who understands ""a judge's job is to interpret the law, not make the law."" But in cases where the law's unclear, the president wrote, he will look for ""the kind of life experience learned outside the classroom and the courtroom; experience that suggests he or she views the law not only as an intellectual exercise, but also grasps the way it affects the daily reality of people's lives in a big, complicated democracy, and in rapidly changing times.""And, about those times: Senate Republicans signaled this week they will take no action on whomever the White House nominates. All 11 GOP members of the Judiciary Committee signed a letter Tuesday saying they would not give their consent under the Constitution. The lawmakers said they did not intend to even meet with the nominee, let alone hold a public hearing on his or her qualifications.On Wednesday, President Obama blasted the politics of the Senate, and said the American people would have the chance to judge his nominee — something of a public relations campaign.""My hope an expectation is that once there is an actual nominee... that those on the judiciary committee recognize that their job is to give this person a hearing, to show the courtesy of meeting with them. They are then free to vote whatever their conscience dictates.""""I'm going to do my job, I'm going to nominate someone,"" he continued, ""and let the American people decide as to whether that person is qualified.""That means the court could operate without a full complement of nine members for a year or more, the equivalent of two terms of the Supreme Court. At least one current justice, Samuel Alito, commented on that, telling an audience at Georgetown Law school this week, ""We will deal with it.""""There's nothing in the Constitution that specifies the size of the Supreme Court,"" Alito said. ""There were times in the history of the court when the court had an even number of justices.

"State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday that an unknown U.S. official made a request over the phone to delete several minutes of a December 2013 video of the exchange between reporters and a State Department spokeswoman. The State Department routinely posts on its site the briefing that it holds nearly every day with the diplomatic press corps.Kirby said the department technician who made the edit could not recall who requested it.The deleted portion of the video involves questions about a previous press briefing in 2012 in which then-State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland denied secret talks between the U.S. and Iran about a potential nuclear deal were taking place.After it was revealed in December 2013 that secret talks between the U.S. and Iran actually had taken place, then-spokeswoman Jen Psaki admitted the administration lied in order to protect the secret negotiations.Earlier this month Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes acknowledged to The New York Times that the administration was deceptive about the talks, creating a ""narrative"" that they did not take place. When James Rosen of Fox News -- who asked the original questions of Psaki -- tried to refer back to the video last month, he found the exchange had been deleted. Kirby, who originally called the deletion a ""glitch,"" said Wednesday that he asked State Department lawyers to look into the matter after being notified about the omission. ""They learned that a specific request was made to excise that portion of the briefing. We do not know who made the request to edit the video or why it was made,"" Kirby said. Another senior State Department official said the technician found the request ""unusual"" and consulted her supervisor before making the edit. The supervisor, who also could not remember the name of the person who called, approved the request because it came from someone ""from a certain level and credibility"" in the Department of Public Affairs. ""Although this person did not remember the person who called her, or the person they were calling on behalf of, she remembers it was not (Jen) Psaki,"" this official said. ""Jen did not request it, did not know about it and had nothing to do with it."" Psaki, who now is the White House communications director, tweeted Wednesday that she was unaware of the episode: ""I had no knowledge of nor would I have approved of any form of editing or cutting my briefing transcript on any subject while @StateDept."" Kirby noted that the full briefing transcript, including the exchange on Iran, had always been available on the State Department website and that the omitted video has since been replaced with a complete version that had been archived with the Defense Department. He said that was the only instance he was aware of in which briefing videos were edited, though he couldn't be sure there weren't others. He announced a new policy Wednesday in which every video would be posted immediately with all edits disclosed. ""To my surprise, the Bureau of Public Affairs did not have in place any rules governing this type of action,"" he said. ""Therefore, we are taking immediate steps to craft appropriate protocols on this issue, as we believe that deliberately removing a portion of the video was not and is not in keeping with the State Department's commitment to transparency and public accountability."" Because such rules weren't previously in place, Kirby said he found ""no reason"" to press forward with a more formal investigation.","Convert the article into a survival guide, using the events or information as a backdrop for survival tips.",The State Department has recently faced a controversy over the deletion of several minutes of a video recording of a briefing held in December 2013.

"Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush smoked marijuana while in high school, a personal use of the drug that stands in contrast to his later political stance on the plant.“I drank alcohol and I smoked marijuana when I was at Andover,” Bush, the current Republican frontrunner seeking his party's 2016 presidential nomination, told the Boston Globe as part of a detailed new profile that describes his time at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. Both George H.W. Bush, Jeb's father, and George W. Bush, his brother, also attended the prestigious private school.“It was pretty common,"" Bush said of his substance use during that time. A former classmate of Bush's, Peter Tibbetts, recalled to the newspaper that the first time he ever smoked marijuana was with Bush, in some woods near their dorm.“The first time I really got stoned was in Jeb’s room,” Tibbetts told the Globe. “He had a portable stereo with removable speakers. He put on Steppenwolf for me.” Tibbetts was eventually forced to leave the boarding school after being accused of using drugs.As a politician, Bush has not embraced marijuana. He spent much of his time as Florida governor championing jail instead of treatment for nonviolent drug offenders, and pushed for mandatory prison sentences for drug offenders -- with the exception of his daughter, Noelle, who has struggled with crack cocaine use.More recently, while acknowledging that states should ""have a right"" to decide on the legalization of marijuana, Bush publicly opposed an amendment to legalize medical marijuana in Florida.""Florida leaders and citizens have worked for years to make the Sunshine State a world-class location to start or run a business, a family-friendly destination for tourism and a desirable place to raise a family or retire,” Bush said before the November midterm election. ""Allowing large-scale marijuana operations to take root across Florida, under the guise of using it for medicinal purposes, runs counter to all of these efforts.""“You would think he’d have a little more understanding then,” Paul, who may be a rival to Bush in the Republican primary, told The Hill Friday. “He was even opposed to medical marijuana. This is a guy who now admits he smoked marijuana but he wants to put people in jail who do.""The Globe also spoke to some of Bush's former classmates, who recalled a ""physically imposing"" young man who was seen as intimidating by some and a bully by others. Tibbetts recalled a story to the newspaper of an occasion during their boarding school days when he and Bush taunted a smaller student who lived in their dorm by sewing his pajama bottoms so that the student couldn't put them on.Bush told the Globe he didn't remember the incident or any other bullying, and was surprised that some of his former classmates viewed him that way. “I don’t believe that is true,” Bush said, adding that it was more than 40 years ago and not possible for him to remember.It isn't the first time that allegations of bullying have surfaced about Bush's high school years. Another classmate of Bush's told Vanity Fair in 2001 that he remembered Bush as a bully as well, and that there was ""a kind of arrogance"" about him during his time at Andover.","Write a satirical piece, exaggerating the article's themes for comic effect.","Jeb Bush, a Republican presidential frontrunner, has a secret that stands in stark contrast to his political stance on marijuana.

"Mel Robbins is a CNN commentator, legal analyst, best-selling author and keynote speaker. In 2014, she was named outstanding news talk-radio host by the Gracie Awards. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author(CNN) If you understand nothing else about Donald Trump, understand this:He has a particular mindset we see all the time in business -- he's ""the disrupter.""The disrupter is someone whose entire ""brand"" is to break the mold, to turn the way we do things on its head. Amazon did this with retail, Uber did it with taxi services, Airbnb did it with travel, Tinder did it with dating, Slack is doing it with email, Spotify is doing it with music, peer-to-peer lending is changing banking.Disrupters don't fix what's broken because they don't innovate from inside the system. They break the mold, change our thinking about the mold and then hand us the new rules for how things work.Just look at the Big Five companies that drive the Internet economy -- all disrupters -- Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook. They were early movers, they played by their own rules. First they disrupted how we do business online, and now they define it. And they control it. Apple just reported its highest earnings ever. Looks like disruption is working.Today every taxi company in America could band together, and they still would not stop the power of Uber. That is because when you gain enough momentum, you dominate the market and the conversation.In his effect on everything from Fox News to the Koch Brothers to the newspapers that endorse candidates, Trump has disrupted every single aspect of the game of politics and created new rules -- and based on the polls, what he's done is working.And so far, most of the political establishment has been wrong about what this all means. They said he wouldn't last and now he's leading in the polls. They said he wouldn't disclose his financial information or quit reality TV and he did both. They said that every insulting, ridiculous, inaccurate and offensive thing that Trump has said would hurt him. No sign of this. They said no network would bow to his demands for shorter debates -- but they did.Who knows what will happen when the Republican National Committee has to officially pick its candidate for president, but -- holy cow -- it sure will be interesting to watch. And who will we be watching? Trump.We can call Trump the carnival barker or the political side show, but discrediting the one who is wielding new power is what we do when we lose control of the negotiation. It's not politics, it's business -- as usual. This is why Trump understands that he can ignore it.He also understands something powerful: leverage. He is above Fox News, because he IS the news. And he knows that what he says AND where he goes is the story and therefore it is the business asset. So he is keeping control of that asset.The establishment can't play by the disrupter's rules, because the rules are designed to destroy it.The Republican establishment has already lost. Trump will be the party's next nominee no matter how many times he says he won't call Megyn Kelly a bimbo. It doesn't matter how many backroom meetings the Koch brothers organize or what Reince Priebus does to rally RNC delegates. It's over.The newspaper endorsements are also irrelevant, as are the fringe politicians and reality stars who are lining up to endorse Trump. They are all too late.The only thing that can beat Donald Trump now is the one thing he doesn't control: Americans who don't want his services as president of the United States.And the only way they will make a difference if there are enough of them -- enough liberals, Democrats, independents, and yes, even some Republicans and conservatives -- who can appreciate the appeal of a disrupter, but don't want one to lead the country.","Convert the article into a crossword puzzle, with clues derived from the content and themes.",**Crossword Puzzle:****Across:**1.

"Obama To Limit Police Acquisition Of Some Military-Style EquipmentPresident Obama said military-style equipment used by police departments ""can alienate and intimidate local residents and send the wrong message,"" as he ended federal transfers of such weapons to local law enforcement.Obama's remarks, made in Camden, N.J., are an attempt to ease tensions between police and minority communities in the wake of several high-profile police-involved shootings.Under new recommendations, police forces will be banned from acquiring some types of military-style equipment from federal agencies. The proposal was one of several made by a White House task force that Obama is putting into place using an executive order on Monday.According to a report issued by the White House, the task force recommended banning the sale of some equipment — such as tracked armored vehicles, weaponized aircraft and high-caliber weapons and ammunition — after weighing their utility to local police and the ""the potential negative impact on the community if the equipment was used arbitrarily or inappropriately.""Local police departments can still buy this equipment on their own. They just can't buy them from the feds or buy them using federal money.""Obama's visit to one of New Jersey's poorest cities comes as he seeks to ramp up federal funding for community policing initiatives in the wake of a series of high-profile incidents that have frayed trust between officers and residents in Ferguson, Mo., New York and Baltimore, among other cities. ""Camden has long been among New Jersey's most crime-ridden cities, but reforms over the past two years have led to falling crime statistics and an increased number of officers in the community.""Based on a fact sheet distributed by the White House, here are a few other initiatives Obama will highlight Monday:— Police Data Initiative will help police departments across the country track things like use of force and police stops. Data scientists will help some police departments polish an early warning system, using data to flag problems.— Twenty-one jurisdictions will also release big data sets that will help ""communities gain visibility into key information on police/citizen encounters.""— The White House will release a body-cam tool kit that will help police plan and implement body-cam programs.— The Department of Justice ""will begin taking applications for grants designed to advance the practice of community policing in law enforcement agencies through hiring, training and technical assistance, the development of innovative community policing strategies, applied research, guidebooks, and best practices that are national in scope.""","Compose the article as a time capsule entry, capturing the current state or events for future generations.","The year is 2016.

"The Republican Party has put itself in an impossible position. For months they’ve told us, over and over and over again, how unstable Trump is, how unfit for office he is. They’ve told us he’s a “con artist,” a “clown,” a “bigot.” Now that he’s decimated their party, now that’s he toppled every hackneyed candidate he’s faced, they’re forced to perform an about-face and endorse him as their nominee for president.It won’t work. And no one will buy it.Hillary Clinton’s campaign has already done the easy work of compiling the statements made by Republicans about Trump. The result, predictably, is brutal. In less than 90 seconds, we hear – mostly from other Republican presidential candidates – why Trump is a menace who must be stopped. Here’s a few highlights:“This is an individual who mocked a disable reporter, who attributed a reporter’s question to her menstrual cycle…” – Mitt Romney“The most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency.” – Marco Rubio“The man who only feels big when he’s trying to make other people feel small” – Carly Fiorina“The man is utterly amoral…a narcissist at a level I don’t this country has ever seen.” – Ted Cruz“He’s a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot…This guy is so unfit to be commander-in-chief” – Lindsey GrahamSome party elders will have the dignity to follow their conscience and hold to their convictions. Both George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush, for instance, informed The Hill that they do “not plan to participate in or comment on” the presidential race. Neither Bush attended the previous convention, but the decision not to comment at all is revealing. It says, as clearly as possible, “We can’t support Donald Trump for president.”Others, like South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who accused Trump of cynically exploiting an angsty public during her response to the Obama’s State of the Union address, are already falling into line. “I have great respect for the will of the people,” she told The Charleston Post and Courier, “and as I have always said, I will support the Republican nominee for president.” She quickly added, however, that she’s “not interested in serving as vice president.”And there will be many Republicans, like Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and former Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, who know Trump is cartoonishly unqualified but nevertheless support his candidacy. From a New York Times report this morning: “Senator Kelly Ayotte of New New Hampshire, who is in a tough re-election race, signaled that she would ‘support’ Mr. Trump but not ‘endorse’ him, as a spokeswoman put it, a rhetorical contortion that other Republicans repeated privately. Representative Raul R. Labrador of Idaho, a staunch conservative, said he would support Mr. Trump but derided him for ‘not knowing much about the Constitution or politics.’ Former Gov. Bob Martinez of Florida, who retains a strong network of donors, said he would raise money for Mr. Trump but was unsure about his proposals, like temporarily banning foreign Muslims from entering the United States.” This is what happens when politicians put re-election or party over the moral imperative to do right by the country. You can’t say, in good faith, that Trump doesn’t know anything “about the Constitution or politics” but that you support him nonetheless. This is the presidency, after all – it’s rather important that the candidate know such things. Nor is there any room to equivocate about Trump’s proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the country – it’s both wrong and unconstitutional. Republicans let this monster into their house. He’s their problem. They have a responsibility to do what’s right – the stakes are too high to do otherwise. If they choose blind fidelity to the party over their obligation to the country, they’ve lost the right to call themselves public servants.",Reframe the article to focus on innovative solutions or positive actions that are being taken or could be taken in response to the issues discussed.,"The Republican Party finds itself in a challenging position as it grapples with the growing momentum of Donald Trump's candidacy.

"State officials announced major water cutbacks for Northern California farmers Friday, a historic step that could challenge claims the agriculture industry is getting a free pass during the state's epic drought.The cutbacks will affect some of California's oldest water rights holders — farmers who laid claim to surface water more than a century ago — for the first time in four decades. They will not be allowed to draw water from the San Joaquin River, the Sacramento River and the delta that forms where the two rivers meet. State officials said the rivers simply don't have enough water to meet the demands of all rights holders.This isn't the first time during the current drought that state has cut off supplies to surface water users, including farmers. The water board has already ""curtailed"" nearly 9,000 water rights this year, all of them ""junior"" water rights that were established post-1914.But for the first time since a severe drought in the late 1970s, California is starting to tell ""senior"" water rights holders, who laid claim to surface water before 1914, that there just isn't enough water for them. The cutbacks announced Friday impact rights holders who established their claims between 1903 and 1914.And more historic cuts could be coming over the summer. The State Water Resources Control Board said Friday that it's continuing to monitor conditions in watersheds across the state, and that cutbacks could be on the horizon for even more senior rights holders.""Curtailment notices for other watersheds and for more senior water right holders in these watersheds may be imminent,"" the water board said in a statement.State officials said in a conference call that the water rights being curtailed comprise 1.2 million acre-feet, but it's unclear whether the cutbacks will save quite that much. The water board has indicated in recent months that curtailments for senior rights holders were coming, leading some farmers to store extra water in preparation.Sammy Roth writes about energy and water for The Desert Sun.

"WASHINGTON — House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday that Senate Democrats should ""get off their ass"" and stop blocking a $40 billion Homeland Security bill that would derail President Obama's immigration programs.Boehner's comments came a day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the Senate has reached a stalemate and ""the next move obviously is up to the House."" Senate Democrats voted three times last week to block the DHS funding bill from moving forward. They object to House-passed provisions that would cut off all funds to carry out Obama's executive orders on immigration.The two Republican leaders seem to be each placing responsibility on the other chamber for what happens next on the funding bill. Unless Congress acts, funding for the Department of Homeland Security will expire on Feb. 27 and the agency will face a partial shutdown.Boehner said the House will not take up a revised bill despite the Senate impasse.""The House has done its job,"" Boehner, R-Ohio, said at a news conference after meeting with House Republicans. ""Why don't you go ask the Senate Democrats when they're going to get off their ass and do something other than to vote 'no'?""Obama announced in November that he would protect about 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation and allow them to work legally in the U.S. His program would help the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens. It also would expand his 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which gives temporary legal status and work permits to undocumented immigrants brought to the USA as children.The House-passed bill would cut off all funding for the 2012 DACA program as well as blocking funds for Obama's latest immigration orders. Senate Democrats say they will only support the DHS funding bill if the immigration provisions are scrapped.""If Congress wants stronger border security and immigration enforcement, a clean funding bill for DHS is what we should be rallying around,"" said Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., the senior Democrat on the Senate homeland security committee. ""I hope that Congress can come together to do the right thing — support the passage of a clean, full-year appropriation for the Department of Homeland Security by Feb. 27 — and then get to work to pass a thoughtful, comprehensive immigration reform bill.""Republicans see Obama's immigration orders as an unconstitutional power grab and view the DHS funding bill as the best leverage they have to stop them. But Senate Republicans, who have a 54-vote majority, need 60 votes to advance the DHS funding bill and they have been unable to attract any Democrats to their side.Boehner and McConnell have both said they don't want a shutdown of Homeland Security, but their options are running out.There has been talk in both chambers of the possibility of passing a continuing resolution that would keep DHS open and funded at 2014 levels. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has spoken out against that option because it would not allow DHS to hire new Secret Service agents, buy new surveillance equipment for the Southwest border or send certain security grants to states and local governments.",Summarize the key points as if explaining to a curious ten yours old.,There's a bill called the Homeland Security bill that President Obama wants to pass. It would help to protect the country from terrorism and other threats. But there's a problem.

"Donald Trump veered off script on Monday night to claim that “inner cities run by the Democrats” were more dangerous than countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan.The Republican nominee was meant to be delivering a speech calling for Hillary Clinton be investigated by a special prosecutor. However, once again he veered off message in an attempt to appeal to minority voters in apocalyptic terms.“You can go to war zones in countries that we are fighting and it is safer than living in some of our inner cities that are run by the Democrats,” Trump said. The Republican nominee also promised if elected, “we’ll get rid of the crime. You’ll be able to walk down the street without getting shot. Now, you walk down the street, you get shot.”Trump has made increased appeals for support from African Americans in recent days. Despite that, a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed Trump receiving the support of only 1% of African American voters, a historically low total. The poll did have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%. The Republican nominee has repeatedly argued that African American voters should support him in the past week, saying: “What have you got to lose?” In contrast, the New York real estate developer has railed against what he called “the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, who sees people of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future.”The intended focus of Trump’s message on Monday was his call for a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton’s leadership of the state department. Trump claimed that the FBI and Department of Justice could not be trusted to investigate “Hillary Clinton’s crimes”. The FBI in July decided not to pursue criminal charges against Clinton for her use of an unsecured private email server while secretary of state. However, in doing so, FBI director James Comey rebuked Clinton for the “extremely careless” way in which she handled her emails.In the speech, Trump also said he was “fighting for peaceful regime change in our country” and warned gravely of potential election fraud. “You got to go out and watch. You know what I’m talking about,” he said. Trump has long made unsubstantiated claims about “a rigged election” and warned of in-person voter fraud recently at a campaign stop in Pennsylvania. However, an exhaustive investigation of in-person voter fraud in the United States found only 31 cases since 2000 out of more than 1bn ballots cast.Trump spoke in the blue collar city of Akron, Ohio. The Buckeye State has 18 electoral votes, and no Republican has ever won the White House without winning Ohio. According to data complied by Real Clear Politics, Clinton has not trailed in a single statewide poll of Ohio since April. However, despite these sagging poll numbers and cryptic warnings about election fraud, Trump was still confident of victory: “I just get the feeling that we’re going to win in a landslide.”","Rewrite the text as a warranty card, humorously guaranteeing the outcomes or solutions proposed.","The Republican nominee was meant to be delivering a speech calling for Hillary Clinton be investigated by a special prosecutor.

"WASHINGTON –- Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign on Wednesday announced a massive fundraising haul in the quarter that ended on June 30, further cementing her status as the clear front-runner in the 2016 race.All told, the Democratic candidate and former secretary of state raised more than $45 million in primary campaign contributions between her campaign announcement in April and the end of June. That figure, according to a Clinton aide, is the most that any candidate has ever raised in their opening quarter, topping President Barack Obama's roughly $42 million in the first quarter of 2011.Clinton's haul would also shatter the previous record for an opening fundraising total by a non-incumbent presidential candidate, which she herself set in the first quarter of 2007. To set that record, she raised $26 million in the first three months of her first presidential campaign while transferring an additional $10 million from her Senate campaign account. At the time, Obama trailed closely behind with $25 million.The Clinton campaign will also report that 91 percent of the donations it received were $100 or less in value. However, the Clinton aide did not have a total for how many individual donors gave to the campaign.","Reframe the text as a fitness or self-help guide, drawing lessons or advice from the story.",Her recent presidential campaign has showcased her unparalleled ability to raise an astounding $45 million in primary campaign contributions during the quarter that ended on June 30th.

"During a House Appropriations Committee hearing, lawmakers added language to the 2016 defense spending bill stating that ""Congress has a constitutional duty to debate and determine whether or not to authorize the use of military force"" against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIL or ISIS.The amendment, offered by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), has no binding effect. It does nothing to force a congressional debate on the duration, costs or endgame of the war. It simply states that it is Congress' responsibility to have that debate and then vote to authorize, or not to authorize, war.""We must recognize that Congress has an important role to play in matters of war and peace. It's way past time to reassert Congress' role in war-making,"" said Lee. ""We can't allow this policy of endless war to continue. This amendment just says Congress has a constitutional duty to debate and determine whether to use military force against ISIL. A debate. Doing our job. That's all this amendment requires.""President Barack Obama has been directing airstrikes against ISIS since August, and he's been doing so without new congressional authorization. The Constitution requires Congress to declare wars, but in this case, Obama said he doesn't need lawmakers' sign-off because a sweeping 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force covers his actions. Lawmakers have disputed that point for months, so the president sent them a new, Islamic State-specific AUMF proposal in February, saying he welcomed a vote on it, even though he doesn't think he needs it.Democrats say Obama's proposal is too broad, Republicans say it's too restrictive, and their differences have given way to complacency. That leaves the U.S. engaged in a military campaign with no end in sight. The U.S. has already spent more than $2.1 billion, participated in more than 4,000 airstrikes and sent 3,000 military personnel to Iraq in the effort.The reality is that many lawmakers don't want anything to do with a war authorization vote, for fear that if something goes wrong, their fingerprints will be on it. A handful of Democrats have been pushing for a debate and a vote, but neither GOP nor Democratic Party leaders are doing anything to make the issue a priority.Tuesday's committee vote at least showed there is bipartisan support in the House for debating and voting on war authorization -- something House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has signaled isn't going to happen on his watch.""We are not only evading this responsibility on both sides of the aisle, quite frankly … but we are handing over war-making authority to the executive branch, to all future presidents, with both hands. It is a gigantic mistake not to do our job,"" said Cole.Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.) was among those who opposed Lee's amendment. He called it ""totally inappropriate"" to tie a war authorization measure -- even one that just states the role of Congress -- to the defense spending bill.Lee offered two other amendments that were rejected. One would have repealed the 2001 AUMF, with a cushion of eight months for Congress to pass a new, ISIS-specific AUMF in its place. The other would have repealed the 2002 AUMF that authorized the Iraq War. Neither of those AUMFs have an expiration date, and Obama has leaned on both as his legal justification for taking military action against ISIS on his own.","Write a satirical piece, exaggerating the article's themes for comic effect.","It's like a giant game of musical chairs, but with bombs instead of chairs.

"The Republican presidential candidates are seizing on the “top secret” Hillary Clinton emails in the final weekend before the Iowa Caucus, trying to slow their top Democratic rival by arguing her mishandling of the messages makes her unfit to be president.“Hillary Clinton is a major national security risk. Not presidential material!” GOP frontrunner Donald Trump tweeted after the State Department said Friday that it will withhold 22 emails from Clinton's correspondence as secretary of state because they are classified “top secret.”Trump and the 10 other Republican candidates are barnstorming across Iowa this weekend ahead of the Iowa Caucus on Monday, the first-in-the-nation balloting in the 2016 presidential race.Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, revealed last spring that she used a private server and email accounts for official business when she was the country’s top diplomat.The State Department has in compliance with a federal court order released thousands of page of Clinton emails, with classified information redacted. However the agency said Friday that the 22 top-secret messages, in seven email chains, will not be released.The intelligence community has deemed some of Clinton’s emails “too damaging"" to national security to release under any circumstances, a U.S. government official close to the ongoing review told Fox News.“The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton,” Trump also tweeted. “At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?”Clinton has repeatedly said she never sent classified information through her private accounts. Her campaign on Friday questioned the secrecy of the messages and called for the State Department to release them.The FBI is investigating the matter, which has raised questions about how federal agencies have different rules for classifying information and whether some of the emails were marked classified after the fact.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s top primary challenger, has declined to talk about the emails.There is a “legal process in place, which should proceed and not be politicized,"" he said Friday.During the first Democratic debate last year, Sanders famously dismissed the issue by saying, ""the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails!""He trails Clinton by rough 5 percentage points in Iowa but leads her by roughly 15 points in New Hampshire, which votes Feb. 9, according to the RealClearPolitics poll averaging.Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, running third in most GOP polls behind Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, told an audience in Clinton, Iowa, that such sensitive emails being on Clinton’s server is “not acceptable.”Cruz suggests that Clinton’s use of the private server and emails now appears “far more serious” than previously thought and that the most recent revelations put her candidacy into more peril.Cruz, who has 15 events in Iowa before the caucus, is also raising questions about whether the Justice Department, run by the Obama administration, would indeed indict Clinton, if the investigation leads to that decision.“There is an acceptance that the enforcement of criminal justice is decided not by the laws of this country, but by some political hack in the West Wing of the White House.That is not how our Constitution is meant to operate,” Cruz said on the Hugh Hewitt radio show.“If she is indicted, it is difficult to see how she could successfully run for president. I would put nothing past the gall and audacity of the Clintons to try. But even the Democratic Party, I would find it hard to believe that they would be eager to nominate someone who is under indictment and could well face felony incarceration.”Fox News' Catherine Herridge and Pamela K.

"It seems almost quaint, really, to go back to the start of this presidential campaign when the question du jour was whether Chris ""just-sit-down-and-shut-up"" Christie was too much of a bully to become president. Temperament, it seems, was a requirement.Or even go back to Hillary Clinton's 2008 derision of Barack Obama as not ready to be president and take that 3 a.m. phone call about a national security crisis. Experience and depth of knowledge was also an issue.But that's ancient history. Somehow, the notions of temperament and experience have been overtaken by the desire -- at least according to the polls so far in the GOP race -- for what passes as a show of strength, unbound by convention and unattached to complexity. Donald Trump, the undisputed frontrunner, reigns supreme, no matter what the half-formed solutions. As in: Muslims are trying to kill us, so let's keep them out. Illegal immigrants are ""raping"" and taking our jobs, so let's keep them out. Civility -- now called political correctness -- is ruining our national conversation, so let's abandon it.The cliché is that presidential elections are about change, and that's true. Only this one may be about sea-change.This is not something that comes from nowhere, out of the blue. Americans are, with good reason, truly afraid. According to our CNN polling , nearly two thirds believe an act of terrorism is likely in the homeland -- and that poll was taken before the carnage of San Bernardino. Eighty-one percent are convinced that the terrorists are here, living among us -- a completely rational conclusion.Even more important -- and here's the key to Donald Trump's kingdom -- voters believe the political system, including (and maybe most of all) the President, have completely and utterly failed to get a handle on, or even appear to have a strategy for, security. And why would anybody blame anyone for thinking that? Sixty-eight percent say America's response to ISIS has not been tough enough, and a slightly smaller number say that when we do take action (in Iraq and Syria,) we fail. And that's not just among Republicans: Majorities in both parties say the United States has been ineffective in its response to the terror threat. This is not a new storyline. So this particular election-year story has all of the following: Disaffected and frustrated voters. Ineffective president. A level of public fear that has been rising steadily for at least a handful of years. Throw in anger at the collapsing political system, the establishment and the media, and Trump appears onstage like a vision emerging out of the clouds: the dark knight of our politics. Donald Trump is no fool. He's an experienced opportunist. He knows full well that he has stepped into a leadership vacuum that exists in American politics, and has been around for some time: Why should the American public have any respect at all for its institutions when they have been failing? When Congress can't legislate, or even behave? When the President -- elected with such high hopes -- fails to inspire or connect or even explain strategy? When others running for president often look like they're made of the same torn fabric, just with different holes? Trump flouts the conventions, and plays to fears. But for now, at least, it doesn't matter. In a large field of GOP candidates, Trump's solid core of support among one-third of Republicans -- a minority -- is enough to keep him on top, and any Republican running would like to have his numbers. His latest gambit -- a vague proposal to keep Muslims out of the country until ""our country's representatives can figure out what's going on"" is pure bombast, delivered to rally the faithful -- and he'll probably get a bump in the polls out of it. Jeb Bush calls it ""unhinged."" His fellow Republicans also punch at it, to varying degrees. But, for now at least, they're just punching jello. And hoping he doesn't break the mold.","Rewrite the article from an alternative perspective, such as from the viewpoint of a person mentioned in the story or from a neutral observer's perspective.","The political landscape has been tumultuous, a stage adorned with a cast of characters each vying for the coveted position of the presidency.

""He hasn't tried to get ahead in a contested primary by embracing demagoguery ... he's not running to be commander-in-chief by running people down,"" he said.That was clearly a reference to Donald Trump.

"Clinton's campaign, which started raising money for the Democratic National Committee and state Democratic parties this quarter through the Hillary Victory Fund, also raised $18 million in the joint fundraising effort, meaning the campaign raised a total of $55 million for the quarter.In all, the Clinton campaign has raised $112 million for the primary since launching in April. Heading into 2016, the campaign has roughly $38 million cash on hand, according to aides.The haul, which is larger than even some Clinton aides expected, puts a big number on the board that Vermont Sen.

CNN reported earlier this week that Clinton raised at least $21 million at fundraisers she personally headlined in the fourth quarter of 2015, a number that almost guaranteed she would break the $100 million goal. The Democratic front-runner headlined a total of 58 fundraisers in the fourth quarter, a pace identical to the 58 events she headlined in the second and third quarters of 2015. The labor-intensive process, which required Clinton to criss-cross the country on both the campaign and fundraising trail, saw the former secretary of state headline fundraisers in 20 states and Washington, D.C. Thirteen events were in New York, the most of any state, and six were in California. The fourth quarter also saw Clinton get more help than usual on the fundraising trail. Former President Bill Clinton headlined dozens of fundraisers in 14 states and Washington, D.C., including events in Texas, Wisconsin and Ohio, during the fourth quarter. While it will be difficult for Sanders to turn in a bigger haul than Clinton, the Vermont senator is expected to bring in a sizable haul, largely buoyed by his strong online contributions. Since launching his campaign, Sanders has solicited over 2.3 million donations and raised over $40 million -- including a sizable $26 million in the third quarter. Aides have said that the campaign is focused on surpassing 1 million donors by the end of the year. Like Clinton, Sanders also signed a joint fundraising effort with the DNC this quarter, starting to raise money for the national party in November. Clinton aides boasted on Friday that 94% of their donations were in increments of $100 or less and more than 60% of donations were from women.

"With the provisions of the Patriot Act which allow the National Security Administration to collect data on Americans' phone calls newly expired, a new CNN/ORC poll finds 61% of Americans think the law ought to be renewed, including majorities across party lines, while 36% say it should not be reinstated.Republican leaders in the Senate are working to pass a bill to reinstate the law, after delays led by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky), whose presidential campaign has been noted for its appeal to independent voters and younger Republicans, and other surveillance opponents led to the law's expiration at 12:01 a.m. Monday. But Paul's stance on the issue is unlikely to bring him many fans within his own party.Support for renewal peaks among Republicans, 73% of whom back the law. Democrats largely agree, with 63% saying the law should be renewed. Independents are least apt to back it, with 55% saying renew it and 42% let it expire. Liberals, regardless of partisan affiliation, are most likely to say the law should not be renewed, 50% say so while 48% want to see it renewed.About half of Americans, 52%, say that if the law is not renewed, the risk of terrorism here in the U.S. would remain about the same. Still, a sizable 44% minority feel that without the law, the risk of terrorism will rise. Just 3% feel it would decrease.RELATED: Rand Paul vs. the GOP field on NSA The sense that the risk will rise is greatest among Republicans, 61% of whom say the risk of terrorism will climb if the NSA is unable to collect this data. Among Democrats and independents, less than half feel the risk of terrorism would increase if the program ended. The poll reveals a steep generational divide on the data collection program. Among those under age 35, just 25% say the risk of terrorism would increase without NSA data collection. That more than doubles to 60% among those age 65 or older. Those under age 35 are also split on whether the law should be renewed at all, 50% say it should be renewed while 49% say it should not. Among those age 35 or older, 65% back renewal of the law. President Barack Obama's reviews for handling government surveillance of U.S. citizens have worsened since June 2013 when the NSA data collection program was first revealed. Overall, 67% say they disapprove of the president's handling of government surveillance of U.S. citizens, up from 61% in June 2013. Much of that decline comes among his fellow partisans. In June 2013, 61% of Democrats approved of the president's handling of surveillance issues, that has fallen to 49% in the new poll.

"President Obama defended his administration’s approach to the terror threat at a White House summit Wednesday, standing by claims that groups like the Islamic State do not represent Islam -- as well as assertions that job creation could help combat extremism.Obama, addressing the Washington audience on the second day of the summit, said the international community needs to address “grievances” that terrorists exploit, including economic and political issues.He stressed that poverty alone doesn’t cause terrorism, but “resentments fester” and extremism grows when millions of people are impoverished.“We do have to address the grievances that terrorists exploit including economic grievances,” he said.He also said no single religion was responsible for violence and terrorism, adding he wants to lift up the voice of tolerance in the United States and beyond.Obama’s address came as Republican lawmakers and others criticized the administration for declining to describe the threat as Islamic terrorism.State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf has also come under fire for suggesting several times this past week that more jobs could help address the terrorism crisis.On Tuesday, Rob O'Neill, former Navy SEAL Team 6 member who claims to have fired the shot that killed Usama bin Laden, told Fox News: ""They get paid to cut off heads -- to crucify children, to sell slaves and to cut off heads and I don't think that a change in career path is what's going to stop them.""Obama also called on Muslim leaders to “do more to discredit the notion that our nations are determined to suppress Islam, that there is an inherent clash in civilizations.”Obama acknowledged that some Muslim-Americans have concerns about working with the government, particularly law enforcement, and that their reluctance “is rooted in the objection to certain practices where Muslim-Americans feel they’ve been unfairly targeted.”He said it was important it make sure that abuses stop and are not repeated and that “we do not stigmatize entire communities.” He also said it was vital that “no one is profiled or put under a cloud of suspicion simply because of their faith.”Although Obama called for a renewed focus on preventing terrorists from recruiting and inspiring others, some thought his message seemed to miss the mark.“He was meandering, unfocused and weak,” said Richard Grenell, former U.S. spokesman at the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration and a Fox News contributor. “He was talking about isolating terrorists. He doesn’t understand the threat that we face… People are being burned in cages and he’s talking about more investments?”Sen.

"WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are hoping they can bring deficit hawks and defense hawks together this week to support a budget -- and avoid an embarrassment if the conference fails to present a unified front on its priorities for the country.They expect to pull off getting a budget through, thanks to an unusual move to vote on two plans and reluctant promises from some fiscal conservatives to support a budget that would increase spending by adding money for defense.""It doesn't do any good to be financially responsible if you're dead, so I'm going to vote for it and protect national security,"" Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) told reporters Tuesday after a House GOP conference meeting.The House is set to vote Wednesday on budgets for the government that would significantly cut domestic spending through measures such as ending Obamacare and slashing welfare programs.

At odds are defense hawks, who say the budget must provide more funding for the military, and fiscal conservatives, who consider deficit cuts to be the top priority.To resolve the problem, the House will hold votes on two bills: the budget that passed through the Budget Committee last week from Chairman Tom Price (R-Ga.), which some conservatives said did not provide enough military funding, and one that adds even more funding to the Overseas Contingency Operation fund. Adding defense money through this fund allows the GOP to avoid violating spending caps created in 2011, although some deficit hawks consider it a gimmick.""It's going to be a very important moment for our conference. ... I think you're going to see a very unified House Republican conference on the floor Wednesday,"" Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said at a press conference.Some fiscal conservatives may be willing to support the budget, even with additional defense spending that it has offset, because it would bring them closer to a vote to end Obamacare through a process called reconciliation. That would allow Republicans to pass a bill that could actually get to the president, rather than being blocked by Democrats in the Senate.""I campaigned when I came back here with my heart and soul to get rid of Obamacare, and it's the one shot that we've got to get something on his desk,"" Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.) told reporters.That's not to say everyone is supportive of the bill with extra Overseas Contingency Operations funds. Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) said he is against the version that further boosts military funding, but thinks it will pass because of the overwhelming support from defense hawks.""If the OCO number ends up on his desk, the president is most likely going to look at it and say, 'Well, that’s great, but where’s my money, where’s my money for the stuff I want and don’t bother me about paying for it, Republicans, because you didn’t pay for the stuff you want so I don’t have to pay for the stuff I want.' And we are to end right back up in this deficit cycle.""The Senate is moving on the budget this week as well, and faces a similar conflict over whether more defense funding is needed. The Budget Committee voted last week to increase funding for the military, but it could be difficult for the extra funding defense hawks have demanded to get past a procedural hurdle on the Senate floor.","Reimagine the article as a speculative fiction story, incorporating futuristic elements or technology.","The futuristic halls of the Capitol echoed with the anticipation of a pivotal moment in the nation's history. The House Republican conference was poised to unveil a budget that promised to bridge the chasm between defense hawks and deficit hawks.The budget, crafted through a delicate dance of compromise and compromise, was a testament to the intricate interplay between political ambition and the pressing need to address the nation's fiscal challenges. The document unveiled a plan that would significantly cut domestic spending through measures"
"Republican Donald Trump appears to have carved out a wider path to the White House as a number of states including Florida and Ohio are no longer considered likely wins for Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project released on Saturday.The project, which combines opinion polls with an analysis of voting patterns under different election scenarios, still shows Clinton would have the best chance of winning the presidency if the Nov. 8 election were held today. Yet Trump has caught up to her level of support in several states.Clinton now has an 83 percent chance of winning the election by an average of 47 votes in the Electoral College, the body that ultimately selects the president. In late August, the States of the Nation estimated that Clinton had a 95 percent chance of winning by an average of 108 electoral votes.Over the past few weeks, Clinton's lead in the national polls has slipped considerably. Polls tend to narrow as Election Day nears, and the Clinton campaign has struggled to overcome controversy about how she handled classified information while serving as secretary of state.A separate Reuters/Ipsos poll of likely voters showed an 8-point lead for Clinton has vanished since the last week of August.Clinton is still favored to win 17 states, including many with large, urban populations such as New York, New Jersey and California that heavily influence the outcome of the election. Trump would likely win 23 states, many of them with smaller populations.The number of states projected for Clinton has dropped over the past few weeks. Two of those states, Ohio and Florida, were considered likely wins for Clinton in late August. Now the candidates are about even in support. Five more states, including Michigan and North Carolina are also up for grabs.The sample size was insufficient to determine the outcome in Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska and the District of Columbia, though Alaska usually votes Republican and Washington D.C. for the Democratic Party candidate.The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project is driven by an online survey that gathers responses from about 15,000 people per week. Their responses are weighted according to the latest population estimates, and each respondent is ranked according to their likelihood to vote.Once the poll is complete, the project tallies the levels of support and estimated error for both candidates, and then runs multiple election simulations given their respective support.",Design a workshop outline for discussing and solving the article's key challenges.,****Workshop Outline - Discussing and Solving the Article's Key Challenges****Duration:** 2 hours**Participants:** 10-15**Objectives:*** Identify the key challenges facing Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the upcoming election.* Analyze the impact of the latest poll results on the election landscape.* Discuss strategies for Clinton to overcome her current challenges.* Develop solutions to address the key challenges.**Agenda

"The U.S. economy created the fewest number of jobs in more than five years in May, hurt by a strike by Verizon workers and a fall in goods producing employment, pointing to labor market weakness that could make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 38,000 jobs last month, the smallest gain since September 2010, the Labor Department said on Friday. Employers hired 59,000 fewer workers in March and April. The government said the month-long Verizon strike had depressed employment growth by 34,000 jobs.The goods producing sector, which includes mining and manufacturing, shed 36,000 jobs, the most since February 2010. Even without the Verizon strike, payrolls would have increased by a mere 72,000.The Verizon workers, who were considered unemployed because they did not receive a salary during the payrolls survey week, returned to their jobs on Wednesday. They are expected to boost June employment.The jobless rate fell three-tenths of a percentage point to 4.7 percent in May, the lowest since November 2007. The decrease in the unemployment rate was in part due to people dropping out of the labor force.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising 164,000 in May and the unemployment rate falling to 4.9 percent.Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said monthly gains of roughly 100,000 jobs are needed to keep up with growth in the work-age population. The U.S. central bank has signaled its intention to raise rates soon if job gains continued and economic data remained consistent with a pickup in growth in the second quarter.Yellen said last week that a rate increase would probably be appropriate in the ""coming months,"" if those conditions were met. Data on consumer spending, industrial production, goods exports and housing have suggested the economy is gathering speed after growth slowed to a 0.8 percent annualized rate in the first quarter.The Fed hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.There is still no sign of meaningful wage growth. Average hourly earnings rose five cents, or 0.2 percent, last month. That kept the year-on-year rise at 2.5 percent.Economists say wage growth of between 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent is needed to lift inflation to the Fed's 2.0 percent target. There are, however, signs that inflation is creeping higher as the dampening effects of the dollar's past rally and the oil price plunge dissipate.There was little change in other measures of labor market slack. A broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment held steady at 9.7 percent in May.The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell 0.2 percentage point to 62.6 percent.The gains in May were broadly weak, with the private sector adding only 25,000 jobs, the smallest since February 2010. Mining employment maintained its downward trend, shedding 10,000 positions. Mining payrolls have dropped by 207,000 since peaking in September 2014, with three-quarters of the losses in support activities.Manufacturing employment fell by 10,000 jobs. The Verizon labor dispute reduced information sector jobs by 34,000.Retail payrolls rose 11,400 after shedding jobs in April for the first time since December 2014. Temporary help jobs fell 21,000.",Reframe the article to focus on future implications and predictions based on the events or information presented.,"The U.S. labor market continued to show weakness in May, creating the fewest number of jobs in more than five years.

"(CNN) A baby who had heart surgery at St. Mary's Medical Center in Florida died Tuesday, at least the ninth infant to pass away after such a procedure since the program opened at the end of 2011.A CNN investigation calculates that from 2011 to 2013, the program had a 12.5% mortality rate for open heart surgeries, which is more than three times the national average.""Why won't they stop?"" asked Nneka Campbell, whose baby daughter, Amelia, died after heart surgery at the hospital.The same day the latest baby died, St. Mary's CEO Davide Carbone wrote a letter to employees about the CNN investigation, which aired Monday night, expressing support for the program and its heart surgeon, Dr. Michael Black.""The patients we serve are afflicted with severe life-threatening conditions, and it is impossible to eliminate the risk of mortality,"" he wrote.The hospital, which is owned by Tenet Healthcare, says CNN did not get the mortality rate right, but won't say what the hospital believes the correct rate is.Last year in April, the Florida Department of Health sent a team of expert heart doctors to St. Mary's to review the children's heart surgery program. The head of the panel, Dr. Jeffrey Jacobs, a professor of cardiac surgery at Johns Hopkins, suggested they stop doing heart surgeries on babies younger than 6 months.The baby who died Tuesday, Davi Ricardo Brandao, was only a few weeks old when he had surgery in March for a severe heart defect called truncus arteriosus, according to his mother, Pautilia Gomes. She said her son needed a second surgery later that month.In April, in response to an inquiry from CNN, St. Mary's spokeswoman Shelly Weiss said a patient with truncus arteriosus at St. Mary's was ""recovering well and the prognosis is good.""Davi never left the hospital and was not quite 2 months old when he died. Gomes posted a picture on her Facebook page of an eye filled with tears and the word ""LUTO,"" which is Portuguese for ""mourning.""According to St. Mary's, the hospital received the experts' final reviews last year in June. In his letter to employees, Carbone said that since that time, ""our mortality rate has been consistent with the national average, and does not significantly exceed the mortality rate of other programs as the CNN story alleges.""He did not say what the hospital's mortality rate was, or whether it included Davi's death. An email from CNN to Weiss went unanswered Wednesday.In his review last year, Jacobs, the Johns Hopkins surgeon, noted that St. Mary's was doing too few pediatric heart surgeries -- a very complex type of operation -- to get good at it. He noted that in 2013, the hospital did 23 procedures. The vast majority of hospitals in the United States that perform these surgeries do more than 100 a year, and anything less than that is considered low volume by the Society for Thoracic Surgeons.In response to CNN's investigation, Florida's Department of Health and the Agency for Health Care Administration issued a statement Wednesday saying, ""Florida does not regulate the number of procedures performed at pediatric cardiac programs"" and that the Agency for Health Care Administration ""continues to closely monitor St. Mary's to ensure that they are following the law.""","Convert the article into a mystery or detective story, building suspense around the events described.","The heart of St. Mary's Medical Center in Florida was shrouded in mystery and sorrow on Tuesday.

Somebody here is being small-minded and intolerant, and it sure isn’t the nuns, ministers, and laymen and women who ask only to live and practice their faith,"" he said, according to remarks released ahead of the speech. ""Federal authorities are demanding obedience, in complete disregard of religious conscience -- and in a free society, the answer is 'no.'”Last year, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Obama administration could not require closely held corporations to provide insurance coverage of contraception to employees if the employers objected on religious grounds.Bush converted to Catholicism -- his wife's religion -- two decades ago following a tense period in his marriage. Bush has said in the past that he believes the faith of leaders should shape their decision-making.""[S]ome moral standards are universal. They do not bend under the weight of cultural differences or elite opinion. Wherever there is a child waiting to be born, we say choose life, and we say it with love,"" Bush said on Saturday. ""Wherever women and girls in other countries are brutally exploited, or treated as possessions without rights and dignity, we Christians see that arrogance for what it is.

"Five key states will hold Republican and Democratic primaries on Tuesday. The outcome could define the race for both parties.But as voters prepare to head to the polls, controversy over a string of violent brawls continues to swirl around Donald Trump.At a Trump rally in Ohio Sunday, Secret Service agents rushed to protect the Republican frontrunner after a protestor stormed the stage. And at other rallies throughout the weekend, Trump was constantly interrupted by hecklers.Five key states will hold Republican and Democratic primaries on Tuesday. CBN News' David Brody shares his thoughts on the upcoming contests and how they could define the race for both parties. Watch below:Even so, his Democratic rivals are placing the blame squarely on him.""He actually incites violence in the way that he urges his audience on,"" Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton charged.""Trump has to get on the TV and tell his supporters that violence in the political process in America is not acceptable, end of discussion,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, said.But Trump has refused to take responsibility for clashes at his campaign events. He insists outside agitators are at fault, and even laid some of the blame on Sanders supporters – and indeed many of the Vermont senator's supporters did show up.""It was totally organized, troublemakers, troublemakers,"" Trump said. ""They are not protestors; they are disrupters. They are supposed to disrupt.""But with hours left to go before voters head to the polls in Tuesday's five critical states, Trump's Republican rivals aren't backing down.""This will be a disaster for the country because if Donald is the nominee, it makes it much, much more likely that Hillary Clinton wins the general,"" Sen.

John Kasich is out front with 39 percent.Meanwhile in Florida, with 99 delegates and winner takes all, it's a must-win for Rubio. But a CBS poll has him currently in third place. Experts say a defeat in his home state would likely kill his campaign.Meanwhile, the Democrats were the butt of the joke in a fake Saturday Night Live campaign commercial showing Clinton, played by Kate McKinnon, slowly-- and literally -- transforming into rival Bernie Sanders just to win more young supporters.""As Millennials, your voice is important. You're the ones who will decide this election,"" McKinnon says. ""And luckily, I Hillary Clinton, share all of your exact same beliefs...""""I'm whoever you want me to be and I approve this message,"" she says, drawing laughter from the audience.Jokes aside, Clinton is hoping to add to her lead in the delegates as polls show her ahead of Sanders in all five states.Whatever happens, the outcome of Tuesday's primaries will be critical for both the Republican and Democratic candidates and the results are almost certain to shape the dynamics of the race.","Propose as a community project plan, inspired by solutions mentioned or implied in the text.",It highlights the ongoing controversy over violent brawls at Donald Trump's rallies and the blame placed on him by his Democratic rivals.**Key points:*** Five key states will hold Republican and Democratic primaries on Tuesday.* The outcome of the primaries could define the race for both parties.* Trump's recent rallies have been marred by several violent
"The White House and Republican leaders in Congress face long odds in trying to revive trade legislation after a telling defeat engineered by President Barack Obama's fellow Democrats.Obama's ambitious trade agenda is in serious doubt, as is his quest for a capstone second-term achievement.Without the power to negotiate trade deals that Congress can approve or reject, but not amend, Obama has little chance of securing the Pacific Rim pact that his administration has worked toward for years.Friday's rebuff highlighted the strained relations between Obama and congressional Democrats, who voted down a worker assistance program crucial to the negotiating authority measure just hours after the president implored them not to.Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, had worked in rare tandem on this issue, yet their inability to deliver raises the question of whether much else will get done with Republicans running Congress and Obama in the White House for the next 18 months.""This isn't over yet,"" Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., a main supporter of the trade legislation. ""I'm hopeful that the Democrats understand the consequences and get together with the president and finish this as soon as possible.""House GOP leaders took steps that would allow another vote on the worker retraining program in coming days, but that would require at least 90 votes to shift.Republicans sounded pessimistic that they could add many more votes for a program that most on their side deride as wasteful and unnecessary.House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California and her labor-backed allies are determined to oppose the Trade Adjustment Assistance program as a way to collapse the entire package. So it seems unlikely that enough Democratic votes would emerge to save the program, even though the party has promoted it for years.""Some of my Democratic colleagues are in danger of self-immolation"" on the workers' program and ""I think that's sad,"" said Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., one of the few Democrats who backed Obama on Friday's votes.Another possible route is to send revised legislation back to the Senate. But senators approved the larger package only narrowly last month after intense battles, and the White House desperately wants to avoid giving opponents there another chance to strangle the legislation.White House press secretary Josh Earnest dismissed Friday's outcome as an ""entanglement"" and ""procedural snafu.""But it was more than a ""snafu"" that caused Pelosi and the majority of House Democrats to revolt against their president.The White House, congressional Republicans and business groups argued that the special negotiating power is a necessary tool for trade deals opening up crucial markets to American goods.Union-backed House Democrats never bought the argument. They felt burned by promises from past administrations about trade deals they blame for job and manufacturing losses in their districts.Trade bills have always had a tough road in Congress. After election losses in recent years the House Democratic caucus is smaller and more liberal, attuned to economic issues in the wake of the financial sector meltdown and recession.Against that backdrop Obama was not able to bring enough House Democrats his way. Pelosi, from trade-dependent San Francisco, announced on the House floor at the last moment that she would be siding with the majority of her caucus and against her president.""We want a better deal for America's workers,"" she said.","Craft an infographic, visually summarizing the article's statistics and main points.","**Key Statistics:*** The trade legislation faced a telling defeat with a vote of 228 to 203, with all Democratic votes opposed.* To pass the legislation, it would require at least 90 votes, which is unlikely given the current political climate.* The Pacific Rim pact, which Obama has"
"Mel Robbins is a CNN commentator, legal analyst, best-selling author and keynote speaker. In 2014, she was named outstanding news talk-radio host by the Gracie Awards. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author(CNN) If you understand nothing else about Donald Trump, understand this:He has a particular mindset we see all the time in business -- he's ""the disrupter.""The disrupter is someone whose entire ""brand"" is to break the mold, to turn the way we do things on its head. Amazon did this with retail, Uber did it with taxi services, Airbnb did it with travel, Tinder did it with dating, Slack is doing it with email, Spotify is doing it with music, peer-to-peer lending is changing banking.Disrupters don't fix what's broken because they don't innovate from inside the system. They break the mold, change our thinking about the mold and then hand us the new rules for how things work.Just look at the Big Five companies that drive the Internet economy -- all disrupters -- Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook. They were early movers, they played by their own rules. First they disrupted how we do business online, and now they define it. And they control it. Apple just reported its highest earnings ever. Looks like disruption is working.Today every taxi company in America could band together, and they still would not stop the power of Uber. That is because when you gain enough momentum, you dominate the market and the conversation.In his effect on everything from Fox News to the Koch Brothers to the newspapers that endorse candidates, Trump has disrupted every single aspect of the game of politics and created new rules -- and based on the polls, what he's done is working.And so far, most of the political establishment has been wrong about what this all means. They said he wouldn't last and now he's leading in the polls. They said he wouldn't disclose his financial information or quit reality TV and he did both. They said that every insulting, ridiculous, inaccurate and offensive thing that Trump has said would hurt him. No sign of this. They said no network would bow to his demands for shorter debates -- but they did.Who knows what will happen when the Republican National Committee has to officially pick its candidate for president, but -- holy cow -- it sure will be interesting to watch. And who will we be watching? Trump.We can call Trump the carnival barker or the political side show, but discrediting the one who is wielding new power is what we do when we lose control of the negotiation. It's not politics, it's business -- as usual. This is why Trump understands that he can ignore it.He also understands something powerful: leverage. He is above Fox News, because he IS the news. And he knows that what he says AND where he goes is the story and therefore it is the business asset. So he is keeping control of that asset.The establishment can't play by the disrupter's rules, because the rules are designed to destroy it.The Republican establishment has already lost. Trump will be the party's next nominee no matter how many times he says he won't call Megyn Kelly a bimbo. It doesn't matter how many backroom meetings the Koch brothers organize or what Reince Priebus does to rally RNC delegates. It's over.The newspaper endorsements are also irrelevant, as are the fringe politicians and reality stars who are lining up to endorse Trump. They are all too late.The only thing that can beat Donald Trump now is the one thing he doesn't control: Americans who don't want his services as president of the United States.And the only way they will make a difference if there are enough of them -- enough liberals, Democrats, independents, and yes, even some Republicans and conservatives -- who can appreciate the appeal of a disrupter, but don't want one to lead the country.",Describe the events as if they were part of a historical epic tale.,"Mel Robbins, a prominent CNN commentator and legal analyst, presented a compelling narrative in her commentary about Donald Trump's disruptive force in the political landscape. She likened Trump's approach to that of disrupters in various industries, highlighting their ability to break the mold and redefine the rules of the game.According to Robbins, disrupters like Amazon, Uber, and Airbnb have revolutionized their respective sectors by fundamentally changing the way things are done.

"WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday threw out an appeals court decision that went against the University of Notre Dame over its religious objections to the Obamacare health law's contraception requirement.The justices asked the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider its decision in favor of the Obama administration in light of the June 2014 Supreme Court ruling that allowed closely held corporations to seek exemptions from the provision.The court's action means the February 2014 appeals court ruling that denied the South Bend, Indiana-based Roman Catholic university an injunction against the requirement has been wiped out.The 2010 Affordable Care Act, known widely as Obamacare, requires employers to provide health insurance policies that cover preventive services for women including access to contraception and sterilization.In the 2014 ruling, the high court said that Hobby Lobby Stores Ltd could, on religious grounds, seek exemptions from the contraception provision.Days later, in a case similar to the Notre Dame dispute, the Supreme Court allowed a college in Illinois a temporary exemption while litigation continues.Catholic groups say they should not have to pay for or facilitate access to contraception or abortion because of religious objections.But courts that have considered the issue since then have found that a compromise aimed at nonprofits with religious affiliations, issued in 2013 and amended in August 2014, did not impose a substantial burden on the plaintiffs' religious beliefs. Religious rights are protected under a law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.The Notre Dame case was the only appeals court decision on that issue that pre-dated the Hobby Lobby ruling.The compromise allows the groups to certify they are opting out, which then forces insurers to pick up the tab.Notre Dame says the certification process still essentially forces the groups to authorize the coverage for its employees, even if they are not technically paying for it. Religious institutions are exempt from the contraception coverage requirement.The case is Notre Dame v. Burwell, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-392.

"A former military intelligence officer claimed Tuesday that the White House was delaying the announcement of its decision to file desertion charges against Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was released by Taliban-aligned militants last year in exchange for five Guantanamo prisoners.In defending claims he originally made Monday on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" that Bergdahl would be charged, retired Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer told Bill O'Reilly that there was ""no doubt"" the White House was dragging out its decision.His original accusation had resulted in a strong denial from the Pentagon earlier in the day.""They said there's no time limit on this decision. (Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John) Kirby even said there's no pressure ... Of course, the moment you say that, there's pressure,"" said Shaffer, who works at the London Center for Policy Research. ""What they didn't say was more compelling than their denial.""Shaffer, who believes the White House's alleged decision to delay its announcement is politically motivated, added that he stands by ""all of those facts,"" referring to his report on Monday that Bergdahl's lawyer has been given a statement of charges.Kirby, meanwhile, on Wednesday stood by his claim that no charges have been filed. Asked whether there was political pressure to delay the charges, he said, ""that is the most ludicrous claim I've heard in the last few days.""Maj. Gen. Ronald F. Lewis, the Army's chief of public affairs, put out a statement Tuesday afternoon calling the reports, including a similar one by NBC News, ""patently false.""""To be clear there have been no actions or decisions on the Sgt. Bergdahl investigation,"" he said. ""The investigation is still with the commanding general of U.S. Army Forces Command who will determine appropriate action -- which ranges from no further action to convening a court martial.""Kirby earlier said Bergdahl ""has not been charged,"" and no charges have been referred. ""No decision has been made with respect to the case of Sgt. Bergdahl, none,"" he said. ""And there is no timeline to make that decision."" He said he would not ""speculate"" about what might happen in the future.Eugene Fidell, Bergdahl's lawyer, did not comment when reached by Fox News earlier Tuesday.Shaffer said Monday that Bergdahl's attorney has been given a ""charge sheet"" outlining the section of the military justice code Bergdahl allegedly violated.""As a corporate entity, the Army has decided that they want to pursue Bergdahl for this violation,"" Shaffer said.Shaffer said there's a ""huge battle"" going on inside the Obama administration, as some try to ""suppress"" this development. ""This is shaping up to be a titanic struggle behind the scenes,"" he said.Shaffer said the Army ""wants to do the right thing,"" but the White House ""wants this to go away.""He said: ""The White House, because of the political narrative, President Obama cozying up to the parents and because of he, President Obama, releasing the five Taliban ... The narrative is what the White House does not want to have come out.""Bergdahl was held for five years before his release was secured in 2014.But while the president joined with Bergdahl's parents in the Rose Garden at the time in celebrating his return home, the prisoner swap swiftly became a matter of severe controversy. Fellow soldiers accused Bergdahl of deserting his post on a base in Afghanistan in 2009. And the trade itself, of his freedom for five Guantanamo prisoners, drew criticism in Congress from lawmakers who said it sent a troubling signal.On Monday, former diplomat Richard Grenell claimed the administration has ""sent the message"" that the U.S. will negotiate on such matters. He cited an alleged offer, made around the same time as Bergdahl's release, by the Qatari government to trade two Americans held in Qatar for an Al Qaeda agent held in a U.S. federal prison. The Obama administration denies there was any deal.

""They're under my command.

And there were two booms afterward, similar to what you hear with ordnance booms, but more muffled,"" Urr said.President Obama spoke with the military leaders involved and expressed his condolences to the families before saying he's confident of a detailed and thorough investigation, said his spokesman, Josh Earnest.""Our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families as the search and rescue continues,"" Defense Secretary Ash Carter said on Capitol Hill.The Black Hawk crashed as Marines and National Guardsmen practiced ""insertion and extraction missions,"" using small boats and helicopters to get troops into and out of a target site, said Capt. Barry Morris, spokesman for the Marine Corps Special Operations Command at Camp Lejeune.Like the Army's Green Berets and the Navy's SEALs, these Marines were highly skilled unconventional warriors, trained to endure grueling conditions and sensitive assignments on land and at sea, from seizing ships to special reconnaissance missions and direct action inside hostile territory.The helicopter was part of a nighttime training mission Tuesday at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. There was dense fog in the area at the time of the crash but officials have not said what caused the helicopter to go down.Fog had reduced visibility to less than two miles at the time, according to the National Weather Service. Another helicopter participating in the exercise turned back because of the bad weather before the other Black Hawk crashed, authorities said.Despite the human remains washing ashore, the military still called it a rescue mission Wednesday, said Sara Vidoni, a spokeswoman for Eglin Air Force Base, outside Pensacola.The fog remained so heavy Wednesday that search boats just offshore could be heard but not seen, blasting horns as their crews peered into the choppy water. It finally began to lift in the afternoon, enabling a helicopter to slowly survey the water.About a dozen airmen wearing fatigues walked shoulder-to-shoulder down the beach, scanning the sand, while civilian rescue crews and searchers with dogs joined the effort.The Coast Guard said debris was first spotted about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, and that the search area expanded to a 17-mile stretch of the narrow sound separating Santa Rosa Island from the Florida Panhandle mainland.The Marines were part of a special operations group based in Camp Lejeune. They had arrived Sunday for a week of training.None were immediately identified, so that families could be told first.The helicopter that crashed had joined the training from an airport in nearby Destin. The site includes 20 miles of pristine beachfront under military control since before World War II — an ideal place for special operations units from across the military to practice, test range manager Glenn Barndollar told The AP last year.The Associated Press contributed to this report.","Compose the article as a debate, presenting opposing viewpoints on the issues discussed.","**The tragic crash of a Black Hawk helicopter on the Florida panhandle coastline has sparked a debate over the appropriate terminology and the ongoing search-and-rescue operation.**Opposing Viewpoints:****1.

"After the Paris attacks, Americans are divided on Obama’s plan to let in 10,000 Syrian refugees. The timing is good: Thanksgiving can shed light on how much the nation’s tradition of hospitality should influence this decision.Syria refugee Nedal Al-Hayk works as a fabricator in Warren, Mich. Several U.S. governors are threatening to halt efforts to allow Syrian refugees into their states in the aftermath of the coordinated attacks in Paris, though an immigration expert says they have no legal authority to do so.Just as Americans prepare to express their hospitality toward others during Thanksgiving, a national debate has erupted over another kind of hospitality: President Obama’s plan to welcome 10,000 Syrian refugees into the United States. After the Paris attacks, the plan has been widely challenged, not least by nearly half the US governors. They fear Islamic State terrorists might slip in as “sleepers” among the refugees. Others argue back that the US already rigorously vets all asylum seekers – for as long as two years.Might Thanksgiving, with all its traditions and meaning, shed some light on this debate?The practice of welcoming strangers into one’s home or community long precedes the first American thanksgiving, that autumn feast of 1621 when Pilgrims and native Americans expressed gratitude for either the harvest, each other, or God’s mercy (or all of the above). Hospitality is an ancient Middle East virtue, rooted in the traditions of desert tribes and deeply encoded in the three Abrahamic religions. In the scriptural book of Hebrews, we read: “Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.”Hospitality, like Thanksgiving, is a type of giving that treats others – rich or poor, stranger or family – as equals. In ancient days, this egalitarian focus was symbolized by the washing of a guest’s feet. Today it serves as a cornerstone for democracy. It is also the basis for the United Nations Refugee Convention, in which a majority of the world’s states have agreed to grant asylum to people deemed to be refugees.In the US, a thanksgiving day was not an official holiday until Lincoln made it one during the Civil War. The woman who championed it, Sarah Hale, wrote in 1864: “Let us each see to it that on this one day there shall be no family or individual, within the compass of our means to help, who shall not have some portion prepared, and some reason to join in the general Thanksgiving.”Granting permanent asylum in the US to a refugee, of course, is not the same as sharing a turkey dinner with a stranger. Today’s modern nation-states are careful about who crosses their borders, either to prevent problems or to enhance their society. But with 1 in every 122 people now either a refugee, internally displaced, or seeking asylum, the need for hospitality is great. And in hospitality a nation can find its greatness.",Rewrite the text from the perspective of an inanimate object or animal mentioned in the story.,", I've seen a lot of things.

"Implausible schemes to put Mike Pence, rather than Donald Trump, on the top of the ballot have been flying since a once-secret recording of Trump’s lurid boasting about sexual assault leaked to the public on Friday evening.Pence has issued a public statement on Trump’s remarks, saying he “does not condone his remarks and cannot defend them” — but accepted Trump’s apology and suggested he’d stick by him through the second presidential debate on Sunday night. Anonymous sources say privately Pence is “beside himself” over the details in the leaked audio.Meanwhile, multiple prominent Republicans — from former rival for the nomination Carly Fiorina to former Bush Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and a number of members of Congress — have called for Trump to step aside and allow Pence to be the nominee.On some level, the Republican longing for Pence in the face of these new details about Trump’s past makes sense. He’s an experienced politician with a long track record. He has impeccable social conservative credentials. He’s the governor of a state. He can pay attention in a debate long enough to land punches on Tim Kaine. And he has almost certainly never been secretly recorded talking about a woman’s “tits” or “pussy” or bragging about kissing women against their will.But if Republican politicians are really horrified by Trump’s remarks — and not just by the possible electoral implications — Pence made one decision that should disqualify him in their eyes, too: Mike Pence agreed to be Donald Trump’s vice president.Pence lent Trump the legitimacy he needed to unite the Republican Party. He spent months apologizing for Trump, explaining what Trump really meant, and doing everything he could to put Trump in the Oval Office.Trump himself pointed to “party unity” as one of the key reasons for choosing Pence as his running mate in the first place, making no secret of the role he viewed the Indiana governor as playing in the campaign.It’s not as if Pence didn’t know what he was doing. By the time Trump picked him as his running mate on July 14, Trump had already:Nor was Trump’s rampant sexism a secret. His public feuds with celebrities aside, the New York Times had already published a long article on times Trump was accused of crossing boundaries with women in his private life.And, of course, Trump had spent years publicly doubting that President Obama was born in the United States.This is not a complete list. But by the time Trump was picking a running mate, it was clear that he was a man with a history of bigoted, racist, sexist behavior and remarks. This is what Pence agreed to make palatable to the Republican establishment, to social conservatives, and to swing voters.Pence was going against his own principles, as these tweets from before he joined the ticket show:And Pence has stood by Trump throughout the ensuing controversies — Trump’s fights with a Gold Star family and the 1997 Miss Universe among them. He’s watched Trump tell black voters that they should vote for him because “What do you have to lose?” and say that the Central Park Five, proved innocent by DNA evidence, should have been executed anyway.To characterize Pence as a paragon of respect and decency who happened to wake up one morning and, through no fault of his own, be Trump’s running mate ignores the role Pence played in trying to make Trump palatable to voters and the establishment in the first place.If the case against Trump’s presidency is his poor judgment and his lack of respect for women, what does Pence’s tacit approval of all of this say about him?","Convert the article into a travelogue, describing places, cultures, and experiences mentioned in the story.","The Republican political landscape has been shaken by a recent scandal involving the leaked recording of Donald Trump's lurid boasting about sexual assault.

And in New Hampshire, Trump's lead has also slipped to 5 points ahead of Fiorina -- down from 10 points just two weeks ago. Trump also took the opportunity Tuesday to once again slam Sen.

"A federal judge has given the world an unprecedented glimpse into the ruthless business practices Donald Trump used to build his business empire.US district court judge Gonzalo Curiel on Tuesday made public more than 400 pages of Trump University “playbooks” describing how Trump staff should target prospective students’ weaknesses to encourage them to sign up for a $34,995 Gold Elite three-day package.Trump University staff were instructed to get people to pile on credit card debt and to target their financial weaknesses in an attempt to sell them the high-priced real estate courses.The documents contained an undated “personal message” from Trump to new enrollees at the school: “Only doers get rich. I know that in these three packed days, you will learn everything to make a million dollars within the next 12 months.”The courses are now subject to legal proceedings from unhappy clients.Judge Curiel released the documents, which are central to a class-action lawsuit against Trump University in California, despite sustaining repeated public attacks from Trump, who had fought to keep the details secret.Curiel ruled that the documents were in the public interest now that Trump is “the front-runner in the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential race, and has placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue”.Trump hit back calling Curiel a “hater”, a “total disgrace” and “biased”. “I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump. A hater. He’s a hater,” Trump said at a rally near the courthouse in San Diego. “His name is Gonzalo Curiel. And he is not doing the right thing ... [He] happens to be, we believe, Mexican.”Curiel, who is Hispanic, is American and was born in Indiana.Trump went on to attack Curiel further on Twitter on Monday and at a press conference in New York on Monday.The playbook contains long sections telling Trump U team members how to identify buyers and push them to sign up for the most expensive package, and to put the cost on their credit cards.“If they can afford the gold elite don’t allow them to think about doing anything besides the gold elite,” the document states.If potential students hesitate, teachers are told to read this script.As one of your mentors for the last three days, it’s time for me to push you out of your comfort zone.

David Bowdich, chief of the FBI's Los Angeles office, said investigative leads indicated the shooters had been in the area the day of the massacre and said the search of the lake could take days.Fox News has learned that in 2012, one of the gunmen, Syed Farook, conspired with former neighbor Enrique Marquez, the man who purchased the rifles used in the deadly attack in San Bernardino on Dec. 2. The plot would have targeted the Los Angeles area.It appeared the two were scared off the idea by the November 2012 arrests of four Southern California men attempting to travel to Afghanistan to wage holy war.The small, urban lake is about 3 miles north of the shooting site.Authorities say Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on his fellow San Bernardino County health inspectors during a holiday party, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. The couple died hours later in a police shootout, leaving behind a 6-month-old daughter.FBI Director James Comey has said Farook had been in communication with individuals who were being scrutinized by the FBI in terrorism investigations, but that the contact he had was not enough to bring him onto the law enforcement radar.The FBI has interviewed hundreds of people and conducted searches looking for evidence.

"Donald Trump easily won the Washington state primary on Tuesday, but his victory was overshadowed by violence outside a rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where protesters smashed windows and threw rocks at police.With 73% of votes counted in Washington, Trump had won 76.2% of primary voters. John Kasich and Ted Cruz, both of whom have dropped out of the race, had won 9.9.% and 10.1% respectively.Trump’s victory leaves him only needing a few dozen more delegates to reach the magic number of 1,237 required to cement the Republican nomination.Outside Trump’s rally in Albuquerque, protests against the presumptive nominee turned nasty on Tuesday night, with protesters overturning crowd control barriers and throwing rocks at police.There were early posts on social media reporting gunshots and tear gas, but the Albuquerque police department said those were inaccurate. Nonetheless, police horses were deployed to control the large crowd of protesters, and some reports showed pepper spray being used. The door to the convention center where Trump was speaking was also smashed.More than an hour after Trump had finished speaking and left for California, where he will campaign for the next few days in the run-up to the state’s 7 June primary, hundreds of protesters still thronged the streets, waving Mexican flags, lighting fires and chanting.Trump is the only remaining candidate campaigning for the Republican nomination, but Kasich and Cruz were also on the ballot in Washington, having suspended their campaigns after the ballots were printed.Dr Ben Carson was also on the ballot because he reportedly never officially submitted a withdrawal of his candidacy to the state.The state delegation, which was selected on Saturday at the state convention in preparation for the primary, is composed almost entirely of supporters of Cruz, whose supporters overwhelmed the state convention in Pasco.Despite this, the delegates are bound by state party rules to vote for Trump on the first ballot at the national convention, US senate candidate and former chairman of the Washington state Republican party Chris Vance, who was at the convention, told the Guardian.However, with seven upcoming primaries, including New Jersey and California, Trump is expected to easily overtake the delegate mark needed to win the nomination on the first ballot at the convention in Cleveland in July, avoiding a contested convention.In a strange quirk of party politics, the Democrats also held a presidential primary in Washington on Tuesday, but it didn’t matter in the slightest because the Democratic delegation from Washington was already settled by a caucus in March, at which Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton 73% to 27%.Interestingly, in the Democratic primary – which was admittedly meaningless as it has no bearing on the number of delegates as opposed to the caucuses – Clinton won comfortably, 53.63% to 46.37%, implying that perhaps Democratic voters want the primary season to be, finally, over with.","Incorporate economic analysis into the article, discussing the financial implications of the events or information.","Donald Trump easily won the Washington state primary on Tuesday, but his victory was overshadowed by violence outside a rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where protesters smashed windows and threw rocks at police.The financial implications of the events are as follows:- Trump's victory leaves him only needing a few dozen more delegates to reach the magic number of 1,237 required to cement the Republican nomination.

"Obama Looking For Justice Who Will 'Interpret' The Law, Not 'Make' ItThe legal world has a new blogger: former constitutional law professor and current President Barack Obama.The president took to SCOTUSblog, the leading online chronicle of the Supreme Court, on Wednesday to offer some ""spoiler-free insights"" into what he is seeking in a justice to replace the late Antonin Scalia.Aside from ""mastery of the law,"" Obama said he wants to choose a nominee who understands ""a judge's job is to interpret the law, not make the law."" But in cases where the law's unclear, the president wrote, he will look for ""the kind of life experience learned outside the classroom and the courtroom; experience that suggests he or she views the law not only as an intellectual exercise, but also grasps the way it affects the daily reality of people's lives in a big, complicated democracy, and in rapidly changing times.""And, about those times: Senate Republicans signaled this week they will take no action on whomever the White House nominates. All 11 GOP members of the Judiciary Committee signed a letter Tuesday saying they would not give their consent under the Constitution. The lawmakers said they did not intend to even meet with the nominee, let alone hold a public hearing on his or her qualifications.On Wednesday, President Obama blasted the politics of the Senate, and said the American people would have the chance to judge his nominee — something of a public relations campaign.""My hope an expectation is that once there is an actual nominee... that those on the judiciary committee recognize that their job is to give this person a hearing, to show the courtesy of meeting with them. They are then free to vote whatever their conscience dictates.""""I'm going to do my job, I'm going to nominate someone,"" he continued, ""and let the American people decide as to whether that person is qualified.""That means the court could operate without a full complement of nine members for a year or more, the equivalent of two terms of the Supreme Court. At least one current justice, Samuel Alito, commented on that, telling an audience at Georgetown Law school this week, ""We will deal with it.""""There's nothing in the Constitution that specifies the size of the Supreme Court,"" Alito said.

"It seems almost quaint, really, to go back to the start of this presidential campaign when the question du jour was whether Chris ""just-sit-down-and-shut-up"" Christie was too much of a bully to become president. Temperament, it seems, was a requirement.Or even go back to Hillary Clinton's 2008 derision of Barack Obama as not ready to be president and take that 3 a.m. phone call about a national security crisis. Experience and depth of knowledge was also an issue.But that's ancient history. Somehow, the notions of temperament and experience have been overtaken by the desire -- at least according to the polls so far in the GOP race -- for what passes as a show of strength, unbound by convention and unattached to complexity. Donald Trump, the undisputed frontrunner, reigns supreme, no matter what the half-formed solutions. As in: Muslims are trying to kill us, so let's keep them out. Illegal immigrants are ""raping"" and taking our jobs, so let's keep them out. Civility -- now called political correctness -- is ruining our national conversation, so let's abandon it.The cliché is that presidential elections are about change, and that's true. Only this one may be about sea-change.This is not something that comes from nowhere, out of the blue. Americans are, with good reason, truly afraid. According to our CNN polling , nearly two thirds believe an act of terrorism is likely in the homeland -- and that poll was taken before the carnage of San Bernardino. Eighty-one percent are convinced that the terrorists are here, living among us -- a completely rational conclusion.Even more important -- and here's the key to Donald Trump's kingdom -- voters believe the political system, including (and maybe most of all) the President, have completely and utterly failed to get a handle on, or even appear to have a strategy for, security. And why would anybody blame anyone for thinking that? Sixty-eight percent say America's response to ISIS has not been tough enough, and a slightly smaller number say that when we do take action (in Iraq and Syria,) we fail. And that's not just among Republicans: Majorities in both parties say the United States has been ineffective in its response to the terror threat. This is not a new storyline. So this particular election-year story has all of the following: Disaffected and frustrated voters. Ineffective president. A level of public fear that has been rising steadily for at least a handful of years. Throw in anger at the collapsing political system, the establishment and the media, and Trump appears onstage like a vision emerging out of the clouds: the dark knight of our politics. Donald Trump is no fool. He's an experienced opportunist. He knows full well that he has stepped into a leadership vacuum that exists in American politics, and has been around for some time: Why should the American public have any respect at all for its institutions when they have been failing? When Congress can't legislate, or even behave? When the President -- elected with such high hopes -- fails to inspire or connect or even explain strategy? When others running for president often look like they're made of the same torn fabric, just with different holes? Trump flouts the conventions, and plays to fears. But for now, at least, it doesn't matter. In a large field of GOP candidates, Trump's solid core of support among one-third of Republicans -- a minority -- is enough to keep him on top, and any Republican running would like to have his numbers. His latest gambit -- a vague proposal to keep Muslims out of the country until ""our country's representatives can figure out what's going on"" is pure bombast, delivered to rally the faithful -- and he'll probably get a bump in the polls out of it. Jeb Bush calls it ""unhinged."" His fellow Republicans also punch at it, to varying degrees. But, for now at least, they're just punching jello. And hoping he doesn't break the mold.","Reframe the text as an escape room scenario, with puzzles and challenges based on the story.","**The Temperament Challenge:**Step into the past and uncover the temperamental requirements for presidential office.

"Hillary Clinton didn't just take the vast majority of the available delegates in South Carolina on Saturday night. She also took away one of Bernie Sanders's strongest arguments — that he's the candidate who has the most working-class support.In Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders had done better than Clinton among voters in the lowest income brackets. That seemed to bolster his claim that his ""political revolution"" could energize millions of new low-income voters who typically don't turn out to vote.This argument, however, is much less tenable after tonight. Clinton did best among poor voters in South Carolina, taking 82 percent of those who earn under $30,000 on her way to a 37-point victory, according to exit polling by the New York Times.Here are the results by income, according to the Times:Of course, this discrepancy is largely driven by Clinton's huge 87-13 margin of victory over black voters. But that's the point — outside of states like Iowa and New Hampshire, many low-income and working-class voters aren't white. Unless Sanders is able to win working-class voters beyond the whitest electorates in the country, his revolution may be over almost as soon as it started.","Rewrite the text as a series of public service announcements, highlighting key messages or warnings.","****Public Service Announcement #1:**""The results of the South Carolina primary have shown that Hillary Clinton has a strong lead among working-class voters.

"It's hard not to like Joe Biden. I've seen him speak in person several times, and his love for people and politics is downright infectious. I'm sad he announced Wednesday he is not running for president, because he's fun and he would have lit up the campaign.But I think he made the right decision.The path to winning the Democratic nomination certainly wasn't clear, let alone easy, and it's better for Biden to end his career at the high point of the vice presidency rather than try for the presidency once again and fail. And while Biden seems genuinely to relish campaigning, campaigns are getting less and less fun by the day. The truth is that a Biden candidacy would have been enjoyable for voters (and the media). But it probably wouldn't have been very enjoyable for Biden.More substantively, a Biden candidacy might simply have muddied the otherwise helpfully clear waters between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.Take the first Democratic debate, where Clinton tried to argue that her plan for how to deal with the ills and excesses of Wall Street was ""more comprehensive"" and ""tougher"" than Sanders'. Sanders' response? ""Well, that's not true.""On this issue, Sanders is right. He is a lifelong economic populist, to the point where he's not afraid to criticize the structural failings of capitalism and change the underlying rules of the game to make sure the economy helps poor people and working families. Clinton, on the other hand, has certainly embraced some of the rhetoric of populism in her latest campaign. But the extent to which it courses through her bones -- let alone her policies -- is questionable. In the middle of this debate would have been Biden. The vice president has more populist street cred from the get-go, especially rhetorically. I don't think I've ever heard Biden speak without mentioning his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. More importantly, despite a lofty career since then, he's always managed to maintain a straight shooter, ""Regular Joe"" style. But on policies, he's more closely aligned with Clinton than Sanders. Biden voted in favor of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act , which repealed part of the Glass-Steagall Act, opening the door to banks to engage in the wild risk-taking that crashed the economy. Biden sided with big banks in making it harder for Americans to reduce their amount of student debt. And Biden supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal (as Clinton did for a while before recently changing her view ). With a little more than a year until the presidential election, it's essential for Democratic voters -- and Americans in general -- to see a debate in the primaries in which conventional centrist economic policy is exposed and evaluated in light of a viable, populist alternative. Clinton and Sanders are having that very real and important debate. ""Regular Joe,"" who repeatedly promotes centrist policies that most help the country's elite, would have unhelpfully complicated things. ""I can die a happy man never having been president of the United States of America,"" Biden once told a reporter. ""But it doesn't mean I won't run."" Now, apparently he won't run. And while we should be grateful for his public service up until now, his decision is also a public service -- because the Democratic primary will run better without him.",Format as a series of postcards from someone living through the article's events.,"The writer expresses their opinion that President Biden should not run for re-election and explains why.**Postcard 1:**""It's hard not to like Joe Biden.

"Clinton's campaign, which started raising money for the Democratic National Committee and state Democratic parties this quarter through the Hillary Victory Fund, also raised $18 million in the joint fundraising effort, meaning the campaign raised a total of $55 million for the quarter.In all, the Clinton campaign has raised $112 million for the primary since launching in April. Heading into 2016, the campaign has roughly $38 million cash on hand, according to aides.The haul, which is larger than even some Clinton aides expected, puts a big number on the board that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders -- her main primary challenger -- is unlikely to top.""Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have joined together and powered this historic campaign, we are now heading into Iowa and New Hampshire with the resources we need to be successful,"" Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, said in a statement on Friday.""Helping Democratic candidates win up and down the ticket is a top priority for Hillary Clinton which is why she's also proud to be doing her part to ensure Democrats have the resources we need to win."" CNN reported earlier this week that Clinton raised at least $21 million at fundraisers she personally headlined in the fourth quarter of 2015, a number that almost guaranteed she would break the $100 million goal. The Democratic front-runner headlined a total of 58 fundraisers in the fourth quarter, a pace identical to the 58 events she headlined in the second and third quarters of 2015. The labor-intensive process, which required Clinton to criss-cross the country on both the campaign and fundraising trail, saw the former secretary of state headline fundraisers in 20 states and Washington, D.C. Thirteen events were in New York, the most of any state, and six were in California. The fourth quarter also saw Clinton get more help than usual on the fundraising trail. Former President Bill Clinton headlined dozens of fundraisers in 14 states and Washington, D.C., including events in Texas, Wisconsin and Ohio, during the fourth quarter. While it will be difficult for Sanders to turn in a bigger haul than Clinton, the Vermont senator is expected to bring in a sizable haul, largely buoyed by his strong online contributions. Since launching his campaign, Sanders has solicited over 2.3 million donations and raised over $40 million -- including a sizable $26 million in the third quarter. Aides have said that the campaign is focused on surpassing 1 million donors by the end of the year. Like Clinton, Sanders also signed a joint fundraising effort with the DNC this quarter, starting to raise money for the national party in November. Clinton aides boasted on Friday that 94% of their donations were in increments of $100 or less and more than 60% of donations were from women.

"""We are behind.

That would've meant Trump running mate Mike Pence would've been term-limited out of office halfway through his 12-year tenure representing Indiana. ""He was definitely living in the swamp,"" Conway said of Pence, who led fiscal conservative fights like opposing the bank bailout pushed by his own party's President George W. Bush.

"In some gas stations around the country, the price of a gallon of regular has dropped below $1.42. AAA and GasBuddy, two organizations that follow gasoline prices, say that gasoline prices below $2 will not be unusual in most of the United States. As oil prices fall, and refinery capacity stays strong, the price of gas could reach $1 a gallon in some areas, a level last reached in 1999. As a matter of fact, the entire states of Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Caroline have gas prices that average at or below $1.75.Gasoline prices are driven mostly by four factors: oil prices, proximity to refineries, refinery capacity and state taxes and levies. Oil prices have dropped below $33 a barrel and continue to collapse. The recent decision by Saudi Arabia to continue to keep its oil exports high essentially has dissolved the OPEC cartel. The decision also has forced the kingdom to chop its 2016 budget. This ongoing supply glut guarantees oversupply of crude. At the same time, slowing national economies in the largest countries, including China, will lower demand. China now tops the list of oil importers, according to the Financial Times, having moved ahead of the United States.The cost of producing oil from shale deposits, particularly in the United States, is greater in some cases than what it can be sold for. Nonetheless, parts of this industry continue pumping, increasing supply, while others go bankrupt because they cannot survive with crude prices so low.Several states house large refineries or are close to those that do. This is particularly the case near the Gulf of Mexico, including the massive refinery operations south of Houston. Some owned by Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) process several hundreds of thousands of barrels per day. Proximity to refineries is a factor in gasoline prices, if the refineries are running at or near capacity and produce gasoline instead of other petroleum products.Finally, gas taxes in several states are well below the national average of $0.4869 a gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. In some low gas price states, these taxes are below $0.40. This includes South Carolina at $0.3515, Missouri at $0.3570 and Oklahoma at $0.3540. Low gas taxes in these states compound the effect of falling oil prices.The odds grow each day that gas prices will be $1 a gallon in some areas in the United States, particularly those where prices are already close to hitting $1.40 — and falling.24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

That has put them on a collision course with Obama, who last summer proclaimed, ""We should do everything we can to strengthen unions in this country.""""The president's insistence on vetoing this pipeline is directly taking away income from these union members, and they, understandably, don't like it,"" Sherk said.Congress has passed a measure to expedite the Keystone project, although Obama has vowed to veto it.

He could have been killed in the shoot-down of his jet, when he came under fire during his parachute descent or in a barrage of fire that the rebels laid down to prevent the pilots from heading to a regime-held area nearby.The spokesman said the group does not know the condition or whereabouts of the second pilot. He may have run to regime-held areas.Update at 3:10 p.m. ET: Rebels Say They Downed CopterAnother Syrian rebel group, the First Coastal Division, tells NPR that it destroyed a Russian helicopter that had landed about 7 km from the area where the Russian jet was downed.The helicopter was shot down by a TOW missile provided by a covert U.S. program to support Syrian rebels, according to the media director for the group, which is part of the Free Syrian Army coalition.The media director did not have information on the Russian crew of the helicopter. The group has released a video purporting to show the attack on the helicopter, showing it engulfed in a huge explosion.NATO officials held an extraordinary meeting to discuss the incident. Afterward, NATO's secretary general Jens Stoltenberg released a statement saying, ""We stand in solidarity with Turkey and support the territorial integrity of our NATO ally, Turkey"":The downing of the warplane figured into today's White House meeting between President Obama and French President Francois Hollande, who is trying to shore up support following the recent attacks in Paris.Obama said Turkey had the right to defend its territory. But he also said both sides need to find out what happened and to ""discourage any kind of escalation."" The president added:","Compose the article as a bookmark, with a brief summary or quote that captures the story's essence.","The incident between Turkey and Russia over the downing of a Russian warplane near the border with Syria has sparked international tension. Turkey claims that the warplane violated its airspace and was shot down after issuing multiple warnings. Russia maintains that the plane was flying within Syrian territory and that the pilots ejected safely. The incident has led to calls for international action and a meeting between President Obama and French President Francois Hollande.""We stand in solidarity with Turkey and support the territorial integrity"
"Really the only unusual or exciting thing about this jobs report is how unusual it is for something so thoroughly expected and non-game-changing to happen. Adding a bit over 200,000 jobs a month is both what analysts thought would happen, and also a trajectory that is consistent with a continued slow decline in unemployment but no real labor market boom.Dive deeper into the data, and the basic lack of surprises only continues. Labor force participation is up, but only very slightly. Hourly wages are up, but only very slightly.There's nothing about this jobs report that is likely to change the Federal Reserve's mind about anything, and therefore no reason to expect financial markets to have any particular reaction. Those who think the Fed's current course is dangerously inflationary will keep thinking that. Those who (more correctly!) think the Fed's current course is unreasonably inflation-averse will keep thinking that, as well. Janet Yellen will keep thinking she's on the right track.Wage growth appears to have settled into a steady pattern that is somewhat better than what we saw at the depths of the recession, but far below what was considered normal before the recession. Partially offsetting this, overall consumer price inflation has been abnormally low for a couple of years now. There are also some compositional effects pulling average wages down as a large cohort of inexperienced 20-somethings have been entering the workforce.Overall it is a little difficult to understand why some of the small upward bumps have been interpreted in some quarters as a sign of an imminent inflationary breakout. Even the strongest wage-growth months have been weak compared with 2006 or 2007, years that were not exactly halcyon days for the American worker.Perhaps the clearest sign of how not-yet-completed America's recovery comes from looking at the level of full-time jobs, which is still well below where it was in 2007:The population, needless to say, has grown in the intervening years, meaning that the failure to fully catch up in job growth makes it difficult for rank-and-file workers to gain bargaining leverage.","Design a museum exhibit layout, featuring sections related to the article's content.","Job Growth and Unemployment:**- This section will display the key data points from the article about job growth and unemployment, such as the number of jobs added, the unemployment rate, and the labor force participation rate.- Interactive displays will allow visitors to explore the data in more detail and see how it has changed over time."

He said his opposition to gay marriage is no more conservative than President Barack Obama's was when he won his first presidential term.""Obama had the same position I had when he spoke about it in 2008, and for the same reason,"" Huckabee said.

"WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday threw out an appeals court decision that went against the University of Notre Dame over its religious objections to the Obamacare health law's contraception requirement.The justices asked the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider its decision in favor of the Obama administration in light of the June 2014 Supreme Court ruling that allowed closely held corporations to seek exemptions from the provision.The court's action means the February 2014 appeals court ruling that denied the South Bend, Indiana-based Roman Catholic university an injunction against the requirement has been wiped out.The 2010 Affordable Care Act, known widely as Obamacare, requires employers to provide health insurance policies that cover preventive services for women including access to contraception and sterilization.In the 2014 ruling, the high court said that Hobby Lobby Stores Ltd could, on religious grounds, seek exemptions from the contraception provision.Days later, in a case similar to the Notre Dame dispute, the Supreme Court allowed a college in Illinois a temporary exemption while litigation continues.Catholic groups say they should not have to pay for or facilitate access to contraception or abortion because of religious objections.But courts that have considered the issue since then have found that a compromise aimed at nonprofits with religious affiliations, issued in 2013 and amended in August 2014, did not impose a substantial burden on the plaintiffs' religious beliefs. Religious rights are protected under a law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.The Notre Dame case was the only appeals court decision on that issue that pre-dated the Hobby Lobby ruling.The compromise allows the groups to certify they are opting out, which then forces insurers to pick up the tab.Notre Dame says the certification process still essentially forces the groups to authorize the coverage for its employees, even if they are not technically paying for it. Religious institutions are exempt from the contraception coverage requirement.The case is Notre Dame v. Burwell, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-392.

"An FBI dive team reportedly pulled an object from a San Bernardino lake Friday, seeking evidence pinpointing the motive and history of the attackers who killed more than a dozen people during a holiday party.One diver handed the unknown item to an official wearing gloves, who put the object in a plastic bag, the Press-Enterprise reports.Investigators are looking for a hard drive that may have been dumped in the lake, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told The Associated Press. David Bowdich, chief of the FBI's Los Angeles office, said investigative leads indicated the shooters had been in the area the day of the massacre and said the search of the lake could take days.Fox News has learned that in 2012, one of the gunmen, Syed Farook, conspired with former neighbor Enrique Marquez, the man who purchased the rifles used in the deadly attack in San Bernardino on Dec. 2. The plot would have targeted the Los Angeles area.It appeared the two were scared off the idea by the November 2012 arrests of four Southern California men attempting to travel to Afghanistan to wage holy war.The small, urban lake is about 3 miles north of the shooting site.Authorities say Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on his fellow San Bernardino County health inspectors during a holiday party, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. The couple died hours later in a police shootout, leaving behind a 6-month-old daughter.FBI Director James Comey has said Farook had been in communication with individuals who were being scrutinized by the FBI in terrorism investigations, but that the contact he had was not enough to bring him onto the law enforcement radar.The FBI has interviewed hundreds of people and conducted searches looking for evidence. Bowdich says it's possible the agency will do neighborhood canvasses in the future, too.Fox News' Adam Housley and The Associated Press contributed to this report.","Convert the news article into an opinion piece, providing a strong stance or viewpoint on the events or information discussed.","This object, yet unknown, has the potential to provide valuable evidence pinpointing the motive and history of the attackers, Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik.The investigation into the massacre has revealed a disturbing plot involving Farook and his former neighbor, Enrique Marquez.

He said that the other likely contender, Senate Minority Whip Richard J.

Those ties have some liberals questioning whether Schumer should lead the party, but Reid said that Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would serve as the torch bearers for the populist wing and hold the caucus's feet to the fire.Of his own decision, Reid said he did not want to win another term and grow old in office, saying he wanted to be remembered for his ""first 34 years"" in Congress and not the last few years.A devout baseball fan, Reid said he never wanted to grow old and not be a real force in the Senate.

"Kim Davis — the Rowan County, Kentucky Clerk who earlier today brazenly defied the Supreme Court’s order to issue marriage licenses citing “God’s authority” — has been ordered to stand before U.S. District Judge David Bunning on Thursday and explain why she shouldn’t be jailed and fined for her actions.In a statement released after she refused, for the fourth time, to issue David Moore and David Ermold a marriage license, Davis said that “[t]o issue a marriage license which conflicts with God’s definition of marriage, with my name affixed to the certificate, would violate my conscience. It is not a light issue for me. It is a Heaven or Hell decision.”“I was elected by the people to serve as the County Clerk,” she continued, and “I intend to continue to serve the people of Rowan County, but I cannot violate my conscience.” That she is an elected official has become a point of contention, because as such she can’t be fired for refusing to abide by the Supreme Court’s ruling. Removing her from office would entail impeachment proceedings, which will either have to wait until the next legislative session or require the calling of a special session, which could be prohibitively expensive.In the meantime, no one in Rowan County will be issued a marriage licenses. Lawyers representing the four couples who were denied licenses told the Associated Press that “[s]ince Defendant Davis continues to collect compensation from the Commonwealth for duties she fails to perform,” they want Judge Bunning to “impose financial penalties sufficiently serious and increasingly onerous” — but that they are not seeking for her to be jailed for contempt. The scene at Davis’ office this morning was raucous, with supporters of both side lining the walkway into it and occupying the tiny building. “Praise the Lord!” yelled one, “Stand your ground!” Another demanded Davis “Do your job!” One of her supporters was her husband, who noted that his family has received death threats and warned people that he’s a firm believer in the Second Amendment. “I’m an old redneck hillbilly,” he warned. “That’s all I’ve got to say. Don’t come knocking on my door.” Watch video via the Courier-Journal below.","Emphasize the cultural or societal significance of the events or information in the article, discussing broader impacts.","The event has profound cultural and societal implications, highlighting the ongoing struggle for equality and the complex relationship between religious conviction and public service.Davis' stance against issuing marriage licenses for same-sex couples is rooted in her belief that marriage is defined by God as"
"U.S. counterterrorism officials are reviewing databases of known terror suspects and other materials after the deadly Paris shooting Wednesday morning, as the Obama administration opened the door to increasing security in the U.S. in response.The terror attack on a satirical French publication known for lampooning Islam left at least 12 dead, and the attackers remain at large. U.S. officials already are in touch with their French counterparts.The attackers reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar,"" Arabic for ""God is great, before escaping.Two French officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, named the suspects to the Associated Press as Frenchmen Said Kouachi and Cherif Kouachi, in their early 30s, as well as 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad, whose nationality wasn't immediately clear.One of the officials said they were linked to a Yemeni terrorist network.All three remain at large.Cherif Kouachi was convicted in 2008 of terrorism charges for helping funnel fighters to Iraq's insurgency and sentenced to 18 months in prison.Fox News is told investigators had been reviewing terror databases, including for individuals who have traveled to Syria. They also looked to closed-circuit television and evidence from the crime scene.In addition to identifying the suspects, the focus will be on determining whether this is isolated or part of a series of attacks.It is thought to be an attack carried out by a small cell, which distinguishes this from recent lone-wolf attacks, including one in Ottawa, Canada, and another more recent attack in Sydney, Australia. Officials are looking at the level of premeditation, given eyewitness accounts that the gunmen asked for individuals by name as they stormed the office.In addition, Fox News is told the assailants showed skill and familiarity with their weapons, and their escape also showed premeditation.A Department of Homeland Security official told Fox News that the department is ""closely monitoring"" the situation.""DHS will not hesitate to adjust our security posture, as appropriate, to protect the American people,"" the official said, urging the public to report suspicious activity to law enforcement.However, the office of the U.S. Embassy in France tweeted that there are ""no plans"" to close the embassy in Paris or other diplomatic facilities in France despite ""misleading"" press reports.U.S. investigators are expected to get more formally involved, but only after a request from the French government.Based on conversations with government officials and analysts, they are looking at three categories of suspects: self-radicalized individuals; members of Al Qaeda and its affiliates, specifically Al Qaeda's offshoot in North Africa known as AQIM; and those who have traveled to Syria and gotten training from Al Qaeda or the Islamic State.The latest edition of Inspire magazine, from the Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen, calls for attacks on France, as well as America and other allies.Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., told Fox News he has confidence in French authorities who are pursuing suspects as well. ""I would think that one way or the other, they will find them,"" he said.King also said the attack should be a ""wake-up call"" for Congress not to cut funding for DHS, despite an ongoing fight over funding the administration's immigration initiatives.Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C.

"WASHINGTON, June 21 (Reuters) - Tensions are building inside and outside the white marble facade of the U.S. Supreme Court building as the nine justices prepare to issue major rulings on gay marriage and President Barack Obama's healthcare law by the end of the month.Of the 11 cases left to decide, the biggest are a challenge by gay couples to state laws banning same-sex marriage and a conservative challenge to subsidies provided under the Obamacare law to help low- and middle-income people buy health insurance that could lead to millions of people losing medical coverage.Many legal experts predict the court will legalize gay marriage nationwide by finding that the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of equal treatment under the law and due process prohibit states from banning same-sex nuptials.In three key decisions since 1996, Kennedy has broadened the court's view of equality for gays. The most recent was a 2013 case in which the court struck down a federal law denying benefits to married same-sex couples.During oral arguments in the gay marriage case on April 28, Kennedy posed tough questions to lawyers from both sides but stressed the nobility and dignity of same-sex couples.The healthcare decision is tougher to call. Chief Justice John Roberts, the swing vote when the court upheld Obamacare in 2012, said little during the March 4 oral argument to indicate how he will vote.The court will issue some rulings on Monday, with more likely later in the week.For the justices, the pressure is on to have the rulings ready. That can be difficult as the cases in which they are closely divided are generally the ones left until the end.James Obergefell, one of the plaintiffs in the gay marriage case, said he will be at the court for all the remaining decision days.Obergefell sued Ohio, challenging its ban on same-sex marriages, after the state refused to acknowledge his marriage to John Arthur on Arthur's death certificate. They were married in Maryland, a state that allows gay marriages, just months before Arthur died in 2013.The Supreme Court does not announce in advance which rulings will be issued on any given day.""It's nerve-racking, it's exciting, but it's also scary,"" Obergefell said while waiting in line to enter the courtroom on Thursday.On the other side of the issue, the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian group that opposes gay marriage, will have at least two attorneys in the courtroom, spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.As for the closed-door deliberations at the court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg hinted during a June 12 speech at the turmoil to come. ""Sharp divisions, one can confidently predict, will rise in the term's final weeks,"" Ginsburg said.Prior to June 15, the court was split 5-4 in only seven of the 46 cases decided at that point. But last week alone, four of the nine rulings were 5-4 decisions. In the rulings, several justices wrote separate opinions in which they aimed pointed comments at their colleagues.","Compose the article as a recipe, metaphorically cooking up solutions or ideas mentioned.","The Supreme Court is preparing to cook up a storm, stirring up a pot of major rulings on gay marriage and President Obama's healthcare law.The ingredients in this culinary concoction include a challenge by gay couples to state laws banning same-sex marriage and a conservative challenge to subsidies provided under the Obamacare law.The court's decision on gay marriage is expected to be a watershed moment, with many legal experts predicting that the justices will find that the Constitution prohibits"
"To be fair, Clinton has been on the ugly end of Republican attacks for decades – a little guardedness is pardonable. But a play-it-safe approach seemed unnecessarily risky against an omnipresent juggernaut like Trump. The Republican nominee’s campaign depends upon free media. In many ways, what Trump says or does with his airtime is irrelevant – the point is to be seen and heard. He can lie and distort with impunity; his supporters don’t care and he dominates headlines all the same.With that in mind, I suggested Clinton’s plan to lay low and let surrogates do her bidding was a bad idea, and that she ought to steal the spotlight from Trump whenever and wherever she can. The same, I reasoned, was true for Democrats and down-ballot races.Democrats still shouldn’t take anything for granted, but I no longer believe there’s any reason to compete with Trump for airtime. If we’ve learned anything in the last couple of weeks, it’s that Trump will never morph into a sane, pragmatic candidate. He was never going to conform to political norms, but one assumed he would tone it down a bit as we approached November. Instead, he’s quadruple downed on his racist comments about a Mexican-American judge and, more recently, accused President Obama of being a Muslim Manchurian candidate who may or may not be complicit in the recent terror attacks in Orlando.Now that Trump is speaking to a general electorate, he’s paying a higher price for his racist drivel. Indeed, the latest NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll finds Hillary Clinton now leading Donald Trump nationally by eight points (49 percent to 41 percent). This gap will grow as Democrats unify and the Republican nominee continues unraveling in public. Even the political press is challenging Trump in ways that appear to have stunted his momentum.According to a Politico report, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid is now encouraging Democratic senate candidates to sit back and watch Trump discredit himself and everyone associated with him, including GOP candidates who’ve endorsed him. It’s a time-tested strategy: When your enemy is imploding, let him. And that’s what Democrats are doing. Calling it a “shock and blah campaign,” Politico reporter Burgess Everett writes: “The blah comes from the Democratic candidates themselves…They’re intentionally playing it safe and boring, figuring their elections will mostly be a referendum on Trump and that animosity toward the real estate magnate will put them over the top in key swing states.” To the extent that Democrats are attacking at all, they’re keeping it simple. Every interview, every question, and every speech returns to a common theme: Look who’s at the top of the Republican ticket? Is this what the GOP stands for? Is this a candidate Republicans are willing to co-sign? “If there was ever a national election,” said Dem. Senator Chuck Schumer, “This is it.” Trump’s campaign is a dumpster fire riding a wave of nativist angst. Why not make every race on the ballot a referendum on him? What works for Democratic senate candidates will also work for Hillary Clinton. There are obvious differences between senate races and a presidential contest, but the general strategy ought to work in both domains. Clinton will have to face the cameras and engage much more than down-ballot candidates. However, if this is who Trump is going to be, then merely looking and sounding like an adult will be enough for Clinton.","Reframe the article as a manifesto, outlining a revolutionary vision or call to action based on the content.","The current political landscape presents a unique opportunity for a revolutionary shift in the balance of power.

"Washington (CNN) Donald Trump backed off a false claim Friday morning, admitting he had not seen a video of a $400 million payment being unloaded from a US plane in Iran.The Republican nominee had claimed at rallies twice this week that such a video existed, saying in Maine on Thursday that it was provided by Iranians ""to embarrass our president because we have a president who's incompetent.""What Trump had actually seen in news reports was video of three American prisoners who Iran had released arriving in Geneva, Switzerland.Trump admitted his error in an early-morning tweet Friday, without actually saying he was wrong.""The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!"" he tweeted.The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!It was a rare reversal for Trump, who has stood by inaccurate or unproven claims previously -- insisting he'd seen videos of Muslim Americans in New Jersey cheering the September 11, 2001, attacks. His political rise began during the 2012 campaign, when he insisted that Obama release his birth certificate, questioning the President's American citizenship.Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine hit Trump on Friday for the video claim, saying he seems ""confused"" on CBS' ""This Morning,"" in an interview taped before Trump backtracked.""I have no idea what he's talking about. It (the video) doesn't exist. He might be thinking about Iran Contra from like 35 years ago or something like this,"" Kaine said.He pointed to Trump's recent criticism of Kaine, who Trump said in a late-July news conference ""did a terrible job in New Jersey"" -- despite Kaine being a governor and senator from Virginia, not New Jersey. Kaine said Trump must have confused him with Tom Kean, who was New Jersey's governor until 1990.""He was confusing it with a situation from two or three decades ago. Maybe that's what he's doing with this bogus video claim,"" Kaine said.Asked if he thinks Trump is confused, Kaine said: ""I absolutely think he's confused.""Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign chairman, responded to Kaine on Fox News Friday morning, saying he's ""not sure there was confusion"" on Trump's part.""The point that he was making is the cash-transfer took place and it was taking place consistent with the transfer of hostages,"" Manafort said.""Again, what the Obama administration wants to do is get off of the point. The point is, $400 million in cash that most likely ended up in terrorist camps used against the west was given in exchange for hostages and the President of the United States lied to the American people, that's the point.""Trump has made criticism of the US delivery of $400 million in cash via a plane to Iran -- the first installment of $1.7 billion in payments related to a decades-old dispute over an unfulfilled us arms purchase before the Iranian revolution cut relations between the two countries and settled at the same time Iran released four American prisoners -- a staple this week on the campaign trail.But Wednesday in Florida and Thursday in Maine, he went a step further, claiming he'd seen video of the cash actually being delivered in Iran.""It was interesting because a tape was made. Right? You saw that? With the airplane coming in -- nice plane -- and the airplane coming in, and the money coming off, I guess. Right? That was given to us, has to be, by the Iranians,"" Trump said in Portland, Maine.""And you know why the tape was given to us? Because they want to embarrass our country. They want to embarrass our country. And they want to embarrass our president because we have a president who's incompetent. They want to embarrass our president,"" Trump said.

"WASHINGTON -- While the Obama administration's decision to designate ISIS's atrocities against Christians and other minorities as ""genocide"" is important, many warn that it's only the beginning of the process.""In my judgment Daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in territory under its control,"" Kerry said, using the Arabic acronym for the jihadist army.It's a critical first step towards protecting Christians from ISIS and other Islamic radicals in Iraq and Syria.""Every jihadist in the Middle East believes they can kill, kidnap, enslave and otherwise torture Christians and other religious minorities and they believe they can do it without repercussions,"" said Johnnie Moore, author of the book Defying ISIS.In northern Iraq, Assyrian Christians are an ancient people descended from the first followers of Christ.""As Assyrians of the Middle East we are on the verge of extinction,"" warned Juliana Taimoorazy, founder and president of the Iraqi Christian Relief Council, an organization that raises awareness about the persecuted Church in Iraq.Taimoorazy recently visited Telskuf in the Nineveh Plains of Iraq, where 200,000 Christians have fled from ISIS.""The homes are destroyed when you walk inside,"" she said. ""Their closets are all broken, the beds are all overturned - the kitchens are destroyed.""Secretary Kerry's genocide designation helps keep the plight of these Christians near the front of U.S. foreign policy.Advocates wasted no time celebrating.

Tehran says its nuclear program is peaceful.""This deal, as it appears to be emerging, bears out all of our fears, and even more than that,"" Netanyahu told his cabinet in Jerusalem as the United States, five other world powers and Iran worked toward a March 31 deadline in Lausanne, Switzerland.Noting advances made by Iranian-allied forces in Yemen and other Arab countries, Netanyahu accused the Islamic republic of trying to ""conquer the entire Middle East"" while moving toward nuclearization.""The Iran-Lausanne-Yemen axis is very dangerous to humanity, and must be stopped,"" he said.Netanyahu's campaigning against the nuclear negotiations crested on March 3 with his speech to the U.S. Congress at the invitation of its Republican speaker, John Boehner, that angered President Barack Obama and many fellow Democrats.The right-wing prime minister, who won a fourth term in a March 17 election, said on Sunday he had spoken to senior U.S. lawmakers from both parties ""and heard from them about the steadfast, strong and continuous bipartisan support for Israel"".Strategic Affairs Minister Yuval Steinitz, the Israeli official who has been spearheading efforts to lobby world powers against the Iran deal, voiced cautious hope that the negotiations would collapse as they have in the past.""We may still have a chance.

Welcome him to our team,"" the former Secretary of State said in a text to her supporters.Kaine, a former governor and current senator, was the —but that doesn't mean he won't have an impact.; the senator’s favorite conversation topic is his conviction that Congress needs to pass an authorization for the use of military force giving Obama the authority to go to war with ISIS.

He’s one of a small (though growing) number of national politicians to handle a mass shooting. He was governor of Virginia , and drew bipartisan praise for the role he played helping the community recover and heal.“By any standard, Tim Kaine provided the exact kind of leadership that VA needed during a tremendous crisis and tragedy,” said Tucker Martin, who was press secretary at the time for Virginia’s Republican attorney general, Bob McDonnell. “I think you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who would say he didn’t rise to the moment.”“You can go beyond grief to isolation and feeling despair,” he said at the time, addressing victims’ families. “Those haunting words that were uttered on a hill on Calvary: ‘My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?’ Despair is a natural emotion at a time like this. They’re all natural, they’re all appropriate. But let me ask one thing of you, this community, as you wrestle with your sadness, as you wrestle with your own feelings of anger, of confusion, as you wrestle with the despair—even you family members who have lost people close: You do not let hold of that spirit of community that makes Virginia Tech such a special place.”All told, the senator is an extremely low-risk pick for Clinton.

"WASHINGTON -- A new research paper suggests Congress helped the economy to the tune of nearly 2 million jobs when lawmakers killed long-term unemployment benefits at the end of 2013.The working paper, by economists Marcus Hagedorn, Iourii Manovskii and Kurt Mitman, is a boon to congressional Republicans who insisted the benefits not be renewed. The Wall Street Journal editorial board trumpeted the findings and the House Ways and Means Committee, chaired by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), touted the paper on its blog.But while the study might help the GOP take credit for an improving economy, the story isn't so simple, as several other recent studies have found the long-term benefits weren't holding back workers.The new paper says the benefit cut led to 1.8 million additional jobs last year. ""Almost 1 million of these jobs were filled by workers from out of the labor force who would not have participated in the labor market had benefit extensions been reauthorized,"" the authors write.They reached their conclusion by comparing the 2014 employment growth of adjacent counties in separate states, since the federal unemployment insurance program that expired in December 2013 offered different durations of benefits depending on a state's unemployment rate. Using Labor Department data, the paper found that counties in states that lost out on more weeks of benefits saw higher job growth. In other words, they were better off without the benefits.The finding is contrary to predictions from the Obama administration and the Congressional Budget Office, which assumed keeping the extended unemployment compensation through 2014 would boost the economy. Other studies have found that the long-term jobless aid in place since 2008 didn't reduce the likelihood that laid off workers would take available jobs.Some commentators, both liberal and conservative, have taken issue with the paper's methodology. Using a different set of Labor Department data, Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research found a smaller increase in employment in states where the benefit cut was deeper.For some of the workers whose benefits ended that December, hardship ensued -- at least in the short term. Things got desperate for Charlie Walker of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, for instance, before he got a new job last fall. And Brian Krueger of Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, only got back to work in May 2014 after going on food stamps and nearly losing his house. He doesn't see himself as part of a happy story about the economy improving.","Propose as a community project plan, inspired by solutions mentioned or implied in the text.","The paper found that the benefit cut led to 1.8 million additional jobs last year.

"WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are hoping they can bring deficit hawks and defense hawks together this week to support a budget -- and avoid an embarrassment if the conference fails to present a unified front on its priorities for the country.They expect to pull off getting a budget through, thanks to an unusual move to vote on two plans and reluctant promises from some fiscal conservatives to support a budget that would increase spending by adding money for defense.""It doesn't do any good to be financially responsible if you're dead, so I'm going to vote for it and protect national security,"" Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) told reporters Tuesday after a House GOP conference meeting.The House is set to vote Wednesday on budgets for the government that would significantly cut domestic spending through measures such as ending Obamacare and slashing welfare programs. Budgets are more a partisan statement of priorities than legislation to appropriate funding, so being unable to cobble together the number of Republicans needed to pass one would be yet another hurdle in a string of difficulties getting the various factions of the conference to agree. At odds are defense hawks, who say the budget must provide more funding for the military, and fiscal conservatives, who consider deficit cuts to be the top priority.To resolve the problem, the House will hold votes on two bills: the budget that passed through the Budget Committee last week from Chairman Tom Price (R-Ga.), which some conservatives said did not provide enough military funding, and one that adds even more funding to the Overseas Contingency Operation fund. Adding defense money through this fund allows the GOP to avoid violating spending caps created in 2011, although some deficit hawks consider it a gimmick.""It's going to be a very important moment for our conference. ... I think you're going to see a very unified House Republican conference on the floor Wednesday,"" Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said at a press conference.Some fiscal conservatives may be willing to support the budget, even with additional defense spending that it has offset, because it would bring them closer to a vote to end Obamacare through a process called reconciliation. That would allow Republicans to pass a bill that could actually get to the president, rather than being blocked by Democrats in the Senate.""I campaigned when I came back here with my heart and soul to get rid of Obamacare, and it's the one shot that we've got to get something on his desk,"" Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.) told reporters.That's not to say everyone is supportive of the bill with extra Overseas Contingency Operations funds. Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) said he is against the version that further boosts military funding, but thinks it will pass because of the overwhelming support from defense hawks.""If the OCO number ends up on his desk, the president is most likely going to look at it and say, 'Well, that’s great, but where’s my money, where’s my money for the stuff I want and don’t bother me about paying for it, Republicans, because you didn’t pay for the stuff you want so I don’t have to pay for the stuff I want.' And we are to end right back up in this deficit cycle.""The Senate is moving on the budget this week as well, and faces a similar conflict over whether more defense funding is needed. The Budget Committee voted last week to increase funding for the military, but it could be difficult for the extra funding defense hawks have demanded to get past a procedural hurdle on the Senate floor.","Rewrite the text as a codex or ancient scroll, giving it a historical or mystical aura.","In the halls of the Washingtonian temple, a tale unfolds as ancient as the windblown sands.

The Democratic senator, who remained neutral throughout the contest, championed many of the same economic inequality issues and Wall Street reforms Sanders drew attention to in the primary.She said tonight the 2016 election ""is not about one candidate, it's about all of us coming together coming together to fight to level the [economic] playing field.""In fact, she was urged by many progressive groups early on to challenge Clinton herself, and the ""Ready for Warren"" organization who tried to lay the groundwork for her run ended up endorsing Sanders.Even though she remained on the sidelines, Warren has emerged as a fierce attack dog against presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump, calling him a ""nasty, thin-skinned fraud"" just Thursday. He, in return, has derided her as ""Pocahontas"" — an allusion to a controversy that emerged during her 2012 Senate run after she had claimed Native American ancestry.Tonight Warren said Trump had cheered for the 2007 economic crisis because he knew how to make a profit from it. ""What kind of a person does that?"" she asked, ""an insecure money-grubber who cares about nothing but himself. ... That cannot be the man who leads the United States of America.""Warren has been floated as a possible vice presidential pick for Clinton, a choice that could help allay some concerns among progressives about the former secretary of state's nomination.But there was immediate backlash online to Warren's anticipated nomination.

"There were several reports this month, based on former and current aides, that Mitt Romney is actively weighing another presidential run.

It’s certainly a topic of massive constitutional importance.

They’re all natural, they’re all appropriate.

"U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday’s unity march against terrorism.Kerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.The visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.The French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday’s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.Among roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.Kerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi’s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.In a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as “quibbling a little bit.” He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.“But that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,” he said.“And I don’t think the people of France have any doubts about America’s understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.”","Reframe the text as a fitness or self-help guide, drawing lessons or advice from the story.","**Fitness and Self-Help Guide**The story teaches us that even in times of tragedy, we can find ways to show support and solidarity.**Lesson 1: Be there for your friends in times of need.**The United States may not have had the highest-ranking officials present at the unity march against terrorism in Paris, but they did send a strong contingent of staff, including the ambassador and the assistant secretary of state for European affairs.

"There’s a conceit that says everything at Facebook is run by data, not people. And we prefer it that way.For the site’s billion users, believing there’s no human puppet master behind the scenes makes its growing control over life more palatable. It’s just a clever machine, reflecting our desires better and better with every interaction, right? For news producers, we have to believe that the platform treats everyone equally: that it’s a publisher not an editor.In retrospect, this was always naive.A conservative whistleblower at Facebook yesterday claimed in a report that the influential “trending news” tab was deliberately biased toward liberal news – something the social network denies.“I’d come on shift and I’d discover that CPAC [Conservative Political Action Conference] or Mitt Romney or Glenn Beck or popular conservative topics wouldn’t be trending because either the curator didn’t recognize the news topic or it was like they had a bias against Ted Cruz,” the former news curator told the tech blog Gizmodo.Silicon Valley loves using the word algorithm to cover the word judgment, but any platform built by humans is always political. The engineers building the products want to skew them toward “quality” content, but it’s hard to determine what quality is, exactly, without making a choice influenced by values.When I read suggestions that Facebook might be skewing its trending bar, my first reaction, as a San Francisco liberal, was to be slightly pleased (any help we can get against Trump, right?). But what if the tables were turned? “I wonder what the psychological effects of it are,” said Vince Coglianese, editor of the conservative news site The Daily Caller. “Millions of Facebook users now have no idea that the things they’re concerned about are the concerns of a lot of people. It’s scary to think Facebook’s intentionally isolating vast swaths of the country.”Facebook’s in a tricky spot because curation is necessary. Truly viral news content tends to be terrible. The front page of Reddit’s ‘”hot” section, an imperfect but useful barometer for the viral stories of the day, currently has headlines like: “Chameleon unsure bug is food or not” and “These condoms are around 60 years old. (found in my basement)”. Meanwhile my Facebook trending bar has: “Federal Trade Commission: Judge Rules Against Agency’s Bid to Block Health Care Systems Merger”. It’s probably fair to assume that the FTC news was not going as viral as that old condom, but a Facebook employee decided it was more important.Facebook is the dominant player in the media today. As news websites lose relevance to readers who find content socially, and as stories are published directly onto Facebook as Instant articles, the company’s power will only grow. To turn Facebook’s trending bar into a Reddit page is not the answer. But Facebook has to be more honest about how it operates as an editor.“Just be transparent about how the words on the screen are getting there,” Coglianese said.If there’s one thing Silicon Valley loves more than the conceit of an amoral algorithm, it is secrecy. And as a social network with a newsfeed of vacation pictures, Facebook could get away with being secretive about their curation.As the most powerful publisher and now editor in the world today, Facebook owes it to its billion users to be clear about how the site plans on distributing news.","Transform the text into a trivia quiz, testing knowledge on facts or details mentioned in the story.","****Trivia Quiz:**1.

Cruz campaign spokeswoman Alice Stewart confirmed to CNN that the mailer was from the Cruz campaign. ""Accusing citizens of Iowa of a ""voting violation"" based on Iowa Caucus participation, or lack thereof, is false representation of an official act,"" Pate said in his statement. ""There is no such thing as an election violation related to frequency of voting. Any insinuation or statement to the contrary is wrong and I believe it is not in keeping in the spirit of the Iowa Caucuses."" Pate continued, ""Additionally, the Iowa Secretary of State's Office never 'grades' voters. Nor does the Secretary of State maintain records related to Iowa Caucus participation,"" Pate said. ""Also, the Iowa Secretary of State does not 'distribute' voter records. They are available for purchase for political purposes only, under Iowa Code."" Cruz, however, was defiant to reporters when asked about the mailer in Sioux City, Iowa, on Saturday night. ""I will apologize to no one for using every tool we can to encourage Iowa voters to come out and vote,"" he said.

"Barney Frank became a spokesman for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality as the country's first congressman to voluntarily come out, and in a conversation with HuffPost Live, Frank had strong words about comments by Ben Carson, who recently stated on CNN that being gay is ""absolutely"" a choice.The former Massachusetts Congressman, who has a new memoir out titled Frank, referenced troublesome mentalities like Ben Carson's as he described to host Alyona Minkovski the struggle of being a young teen who knew he wanted to go into politics but also knew ""people hated gay people.""""For those like Ben Carson, who just announced that it was a choice, I do want to say at 14 I did not choose to be a member of what I thought was the most hated group in America.

"WASHINGTON -- Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) introduced legislation Wednesday to authorize military force against Islamic State militants -- a step aimed at forcing Congress to take responsibility for a war it's been funding for nearly six months with almost no debate on its duration, costs or potential toll.Lawmakers have put no parameters on the U.S. military campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, since it began in August. Since then, the U.S. has spent more than $1 billion, participated in more than 1,700 airstrikes, and authorized sending roughly 3,000 U.S. troops to Iraq. All of this has happened without new war authorization.Schiff's proposed Authorization for the Use of Military Force would do three things: limit military action against ISIS to three years; prohibit the use of U.S. ground troops; and immediately terminate a still-active 2002 AUMF tied to the Iraq War. It also would end, in three years, a sweeping 2001 AUMF that President Barack Obama says gives him the authority to go after ISIS without new war authorization. Some in Congress disagree that Obama has that authority and insist he needs new authorization, which the president says he would welcome.""There is no doubt that our current offensive amounts to war,"" said Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. ""Congress should take action both to authorize its prosecution and to set limits on that authorization so it may not be used by any future administration in a manner contrary to our intent.""Schiff is a lonely voice in the House. Even progressives, like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), have treated the need for new war authorization as an afterthought. It's not much better in the Senate, where Democrats hastily passed an AUMF out of a committee in late December, knowing it was going nowhere. They did so to show their frustration over the lack of attention to the issue.If the new Congress has revealed anything, it's that nobody in Washington wants to go first when it comes to authorizing a war. The White House typically submits draft AUMF language to Congress as a first step to moving a bill, but administration officials say they want feedback from Capitol Hill before moving. Lawmakers, meanwhile, are grumbling about waiting for draft language from Obama when they could be moving forward with legislation on their own.""There is plenty of responsibility to go around,"" Schiff told The Huffington Post. ""I place more responsibility here than at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. They don't have to make the first step. There is nothing holding us back except political timidity.""For now, Schiff is on the lookout for co-sponsors for his bill. He doesn't have any yet, but he said he plans to reach out to lawmakers in both parties. Nobody in the Senate has introduced AUMF legislation, though Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), a vocal proponent for passing new war authorization, has called for using last year's committee-passed bill as the base for new legislation in this Congress.Schiff acknowledged that his proposal is probably more narrow than the White House wants, and that Obama will likely look to Republicans to give him broad authority. Secretary of State John Kerry told senators in December that the administration would oppose an AUMF that explicitly prohibits U.S. ground troops, which some Democrats have insisted on. Republicans appeared more amenable to Kerry's request.""Many of us are skeptical of another broad AUMF considering what's happened with the last one,"" Schiff said. ""There will be some interesting bedfellows on this.""",Rewrite the text from the perspective of an inanimate object or animal mentioned in the story.,"As a proud and ancient weapon in the U.S. arsenal, I have witnessed countless battles and conflicts throughout history. Yet, the current situation with the war against Islamic State militants has brought a sense of unease and uncertainty to my existence.Since the conflict began in August, the U.S. has been engaged in a military campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria without any new war authorization.

"""2014 was the planet's warmest year on record. Fourteen of the 15 hottest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century,"" Obama said. ""Yes, this winter was cold in parts of our country, including Washington. Some people in Washington helpfully used a snowball to illustrate that fact. But around the world, in the aggregate, it was the warmest winter ever recorded.""It's of course a huge coincidence that the visit is in the backyard of two Republican presidential hopefuls who have been squishy on the subject of climate change, and a Republican governor who reportedly told state employees they can't even use the words ""climate change.""""Climate change can no longer be denied,"" Obama said. ""It can't be edited out. It can't be omitted from the conversation. And action can no longer be delayed.""   Ahead of the visit, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on a call that Obama would ""use the occasion of Earth Day to highlight his commitment to fighting to protect public health and to fighting the carbon pollution that contributes to climate change."" And the president picked Florida, Earnest said, because it's a place ""where these kinds of issues have traditionally been bipartisan.""Earnest was coy about the fact that Florida also happens to be the home of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio, two likely Republican presidential contenders who haven't been as enthusiastic about climate action. Bush has said he's a ""skeptic"" when it comes to climate change, while Rubio says he doesn't believe human activity is causing the planet to heat up.The president, Earnest said on the call, hopes the visit ""will prompt an elevated political debate about making climate change a priority."" However, he added, the trip is ""not an effort to go to anyone's home state, but to raise the debate.""Earnest maintained that Obama's visit ""isn't about campaigns, this is about making progress on a priority."" But he also noted that ""the Republicans who choose to deny the reality of climate change, they do that to the detriment of the people they're elected to represent.""Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), also no big fan of the concept of climate change, has taken to Twitter to criticize Obama's Everglades visit. Scott argued that the president should do more to get federal funding for Everglades restoration, because, he said, ""Our environment is too important to neglect.""Earnest fired back against Scott on Wednesday. ""It's a little tough to take criticism from someone who has banned the words 'climate change' for the accusation that the president has been insufficiently committed to fighting climate change,"" he said, referring to reports that Florida officials were forbidden from using the terms ""global warming"" and ""climate change"" in official communications. ""That's a tough case to make, but it sounds like that didn't stop him.""The White House also used the occasion to tout the benefits of the National Park Service, which will celebrate its 100th anniversary next year. A new report from the NPS released Wednesday finds that every dollar invested in the parks returns $10 to the U.S. economy through tourism and other related industries.

"Not even a week after coordinated attacks in Brussels, Belgium, killed 31 civilians, and barely 24 hours after an ISIS attack in Iraq that killed 25, another tragedy: a blast in Lahore, Pakistan, has taken the lives of at least 56 adults and children, with the approximate death toll still rising.A single suicide bomber’s explosion rocked Gulshan-e-Iqbal park in Lahore on Sunday. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Punjab province health advisor Khawaja Salman Rafique provided a statement estimating that approximately 200 more were injured in the blast, many of them families enjoying a peaceful day at the park in the heart of the city. According to local police chief Haider Ashraf, the bomber detonated near the section of the park containing children’s amusement park rides. Pakistani prime minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif has already expressed his deepest remorse for the victims and those affected, firmly condemning those responsible for the attack.In a statement, the White House decried “this cowardly act in what has long been a scenic and placid park,” and pledged to “continue working with our partners in Pakistan and across the region, as together we will be unyielding in our efforts to root out the scourge of terrorism.”Narendra Modi, the prime minister of neighboring India, also condemned the attack.The second-largest city in Pakistan, Lahore has long been considered the cultural capital of the turbulent nation.

"On behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives, I extend my warmest wishes to everyone celebrating Christmas this year.We spend a lot of time this season asking for what we want. But perhaps it would be better to ask for what we need. We have been given so much in this country that it almost seems ungrateful to ask for more. But all of us—at all times—need more of what is good. And this year, I hope that all of us continue to live in what I consider the spirit of Christmas: a courageous humility.It took courage for God to humble Himself. He came down from heaven and became a man—a child in a manger. He did this while knowing that one day He would have to lay down His life for us. He would have to give up His only Son. At first, this might seem like a sad story. But we are to “rejoice in the Lord always.” Christmas is a day of celebration. And it is only through grace and prayer that we come to realize: what a gift He’s given us—what a profound act of love.And so we rejoice. This year, may we continue the spirit of Christmas by facing our flaws fearlessly and by giving back boldly. May we recognize that our way is not the only way—it is not even the right way. It is God’s way we seek. May we cherish all the gifts we have been given—especially the men and women of our armed forces, the people who keep us safe. And may we remember that it takes courage to put others first. It is courageous to do the right thing.May we remember, and be brave—and be glad.Republican Paul Ryan is Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.

"President Barack Obama is proposing a new strategy in the fight against ISIS, saying the battle against the Islamic State will not be quick. In fact, he says it could take decades.During a rare visit to the Pentagon, Obama laid out his revamped strategy, saying the fight against the Islamic State will require more than just weapons.""No amount of military force will end the terror that is ISIL unless it's matched by a broader effort, political and economic,"" he said.The president said coalition forces will go after the heart of ISIS, but he did not call for more bombing or more troops, announcing instead a shift in focus to counter the terror group's public relations tactics.Obama pointed to a string of ISIS defeats in the region due to airstrikes targeting the group's supply lines. But he said more needs to be done to recruit and train Syrians for the fight on the ground.When it comes to lone wolf terrorists in America inspired by ISIS, the president admitted they're harder to detect, saying U.S. national security must remain vigilant.Obama pointed to increased efforts to counter ISIS's propaganda that's spreading worldwide via social media.""We also have to acknowledge that ISIL has been particularly effective at reaching out to and recruiting vulnerable people around the world, including here in the United States,"" he said.While the fight against ISIS will be long, the president said he's confident the terrorists won't win.But Republicans remain skeptical, saying Obama's plan doesn't go far enough.""A speech isn't a strategy,"" said Cory Fritz, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.

"U.S. counterterrorism officials are reviewing databases of known terror suspects and other materials after the deadly Paris shooting Wednesday morning, as the Obama administration opened the door to increasing security in the U.S. in response.The terror attack on a satirical French publication known for lampooning Islam left at least 12 dead, and the attackers remain at large. U.S. officials already are in touch with their French counterparts.The attackers reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar,"" Arabic for ""God is great, before escaping.Two French officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, named the suspects to the Associated Press as Frenchmen Said Kouachi and Cherif Kouachi, in their early 30s, as well as 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad, whose nationality wasn't immediately clear.One of the officials said they were linked to a Yemeni terrorist network.All three remain at large.Cherif Kouachi was convicted in 2008 of terrorism charges for helping funnel fighters to Iraq's insurgency and sentenced to 18 months in prison.Fox News is told investigators had been reviewing terror databases, including for individuals who have traveled to Syria. They also looked to closed-circuit television and evidence from the crime scene.In addition to identifying the suspects, the focus will be on determining whether this is isolated or part of a series of attacks.It is thought to be an attack carried out by a small cell, which distinguishes this from recent lone-wolf attacks, including one in Ottawa, Canada, and another more recent attack in Sydney, Australia. Officials are looking at the level of premeditation, given eyewitness accounts that the gunmen asked for individuals by name as they stormed the office.In addition, Fox News is told the assailants showed skill and familiarity with their weapons, and their escape also showed premeditation.A Department of Homeland Security official told Fox News that the department is ""closely monitoring"" the situation.""DHS will not hesitate to adjust our security posture, as appropriate, to protect the American people,"" the official said, urging the public to report suspicious activity to law enforcement.However, the office of the U.S. Embassy in France tweeted that there are ""no plans"" to close the embassy in Paris or other diplomatic facilities in France despite ""misleading"" press reports.U.S. investigators are expected to get more formally involved, but only after a request from the French government.Based on conversations with government officials and analysts, they are looking at three categories of suspects: self-radicalized individuals; members of Al Qaeda and its affiliates, specifically Al Qaeda's offshoot in North Africa known as AQIM; and those who have traveled to Syria and gotten training from Al Qaeda or the Islamic State.The latest edition of Inspire magazine, from the Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen, calls for attacks on France, as well as America and other allies.Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., told Fox News he has confidence in French authorities who are pursuing suspects as well. ""I would think that one way or the other, they will find them,"" he said.King also said the attack should be a ""wake-up call"" for Congress not to cut funding for DHS, despite an ongoing fight over funding the administration's immigration initiatives.Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C.

"A federal judge has given the world an unprecedented glimpse into the ruthless business practices Donald Trump used to build his business empire.US district court judge Gonzalo Curiel on Tuesday made public more than 400 pages of Trump University “playbooks” describing how Trump staff should target prospective students’ weaknesses to encourage them to sign up for a $34,995 Gold Elite three-day package.Trump University staff were instructed to get people to pile on credit card debt and to target their financial weaknesses in an attempt to sell them the high-priced real estate courses.The documents contained an undated “personal message” from Trump to new enrollees at the school: “Only doers get rich. I know that in these three packed days, you will learn everything to make a million dollars within the next 12 months.”The courses are now subject to legal proceedings from unhappy clients.Judge Curiel released the documents, which are central to a class-action lawsuit against Trump University in California, despite sustaining repeated public attacks from Trump, who had fought to keep the details secret.Curiel ruled that the documents were in the public interest now that Trump is “the front-runner in the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential race, and has placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue”.Trump hit back calling Curiel a “hater”, a “total disgrace” and “biased”. “I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump. A hater. He’s a hater,” Trump said at a rally near the courthouse in San Diego. “His name is Gonzalo Curiel. And he is not doing the right thing ... [He] happens to be, we believe, Mexican.”Curiel, who is Hispanic, is American and was born in Indiana.Trump went on to attack Curiel further on Twitter on Monday and at a press conference in New York on Monday.The playbook contains long sections telling Trump U team members how to identify buyers and push them to sign up for the most expensive package, and to put the cost on their credit cards.“If they can afford the gold elite don’t allow them to think about doing anything besides the gold elite,” the document states.If potential students hesitate, teachers are told to read this script.As one of your mentors for the last three days, it’s time for me to push you out of your comfort zone. It’s time for you to be 100% honest with yourself. You’ve had your entire adult life to accomplish your financial goals. I’m looking at your profile and you’re not even close to where you need to be, much less where you want to be. It’s time you fix your broken plan, bring in Mr. Trump’s top instructors and certified millionaire mentors and allow us to put you and keep you on the right track. Your plan is BROKEN and WE WILL help you fix it. Remember you have to be 100% honest with yourself!Trump University staff are instructed in how to persuade students to put the cost of the course on their credit cards, even if they have just battled to pay off debts.Trump staff are told to spend lunch breaks in sign-up seminars “planting seeds” in potential students minds about how their lives won’t improve unless they join the programme. They are also told to ask students personal questions to discover weaknesses that could be exploited to help seal the deal.New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman, who has also sued Trump University, renewed his attacks on Trump on Tuesday. “You are not allowed to protect the trade secrets of a three-card Monte game,” Schneiderman said ahead of the document’s release. “If you look at the facts of this case, this shows someone who was absolutely shameless in his willingness to lie to people, to say whatever it took to induce them into his phony seminars,” Schneiderman said.","Rewrite the article focusing on its impact at a local level, even if the original story has national or international significance.","The Trump University playbook documents released by a US district court judge on Tuesday offer a glimpse into the business practices of Donald Trump and their potential impact on the local community in San Diego.

"The 11 service members who were onboard a Black Hawk helicopter that crashed Tuesday night on the Florida panhandle coastline are presumed dead, a Pentagon official said, but a search-and-rescue operation was still underway Wednesday in a desperate search for survivors.Seven Marines and four soldiers were onboard a UH-60 helicopter as part of a training exercise when the chopper ran into heavy fog. Human remains and helicopter parts were recovered earlier Wednesday.""It's a tough day,"" Maj. Gen. Glenn H. Curtis, the adjutant general of the Louisiana National Guard, where the unit was based. ""They're under my command.

And there were two booms afterward, similar to what you hear with ordnance booms, but more muffled,"" Urr said.President Obama spoke with the military leaders involved and expressed his condolences to the families before saying he's confident of a detailed and thorough investigation, said his spokesman, Josh Earnest.""Our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families as the search and rescue continues,"" Defense Secretary Ash Carter said on Capitol Hill.The Black Hawk crashed as Marines and National Guardsmen practiced ""insertion and extraction missions,"" using small boats and helicopters to get troops into and out of a target site, said Capt. Barry Morris, spokesman for the Marine Corps Special Operations Command at Camp Lejeune.Like the Army's Green Berets and the Navy's SEALs, these Marines were highly skilled unconventional warriors, trained to endure grueling conditions and sensitive assignments on land and at sea, from seizing ships to special reconnaissance missions and direct action inside hostile territory.The helicopter was part of a nighttime training mission Tuesday at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. There was dense fog in the area at the time of the crash but officials have not said what caused the helicopter to go down.Fog had reduced visibility to less than two miles at the time, according to the National Weather Service. Another helicopter participating in the exercise turned back because of the bad weather before the other Black Hawk crashed, authorities said.Despite the human remains washing ashore, the military still called it a rescue mission Wednesday, said Sara Vidoni, a spokeswoman for Eglin Air Force Base, outside Pensacola.The fog remained so heavy Wednesday that search boats just offshore could be heard but not seen, blasting horns as their crews peered into the choppy water. It finally began to lift in the afternoon, enabling a helicopter to slowly survey the water.About a dozen airmen wearing fatigues walked shoulder-to-shoulder down the beach, scanning the sand, while civilian rescue crews and searchers with dogs joined the effort.The Coast Guard said debris was first spotted about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, and that the search area expanded to a 17-mile stretch of the narrow sound separating Santa Rosa Island from the Florida Panhandle mainland.The Marines were part of a special operations group based in Camp Lejeune. They had arrived Sunday for a week of training.None were immediately identified, so that families could be told first.The helicopter that crashed had joined the training from an airport in nearby Destin.

"For the first time in months, a national poll shows Donald Trump is not leading the Republican 2016 primary race, and instead has Ben Carson in first place.Carson won the support of 26% of Republican primary voters, compared to 22% who are backing Trump, according to CBS News/New York Times . Though within the poll's margin of error, it marks the first time since the billionaire businessman's dominant rise over the summer where he has been bumped from the top spot nationally.The new numbers also represent a reversal from the last CBS /New York Times poll, taken more than a month ago, which saw Trump leading Carson 27%-23%.Carson and Trump have been running consistently neck-and-neck since the start of September -- with other candidates struggling to keep pace.The switch in the lead comes as Carson has taken a clear lead in the Iowa race, beating Trump in some polls by double-digits. Trump told MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" Tuesday morning ""I don't get it.""CBS/New York Times pollsters found Carson outpacing Trump among women and evangelicals and running even with him among men. Trump performed better with moderate Republicans and voters without college degrees. No other candidate cracked double-digit support in the latest poll. Marco Rubio won 8% support, Jeb Bush and Carly Fiorina tied for fourth place with 7 percent and Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and John Kasich each got 4%. The poll does carry an important caveat, however: 70% of respondents said they had not settled on a choice yet. Trump's supporters, however, are more locked in with their support.

"Shouts of “shame, shame, shame” erupted in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday as Republican lawmakers narrowly defeated legislation to protect the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees of government contractors.The measure, an amendment to a veterans and military construction spending bill introduced by New York Democrat Sean Maloney, initially had enough “yes” votes to pass, according to the count in the House chamber.But House Republican leaders extended the time allowed for the vote as they urged enough party members to change their positions to defeat it by a vote of 213 to 212.All 183 Democrats who voted backed the amendment, joined by 29 Republicans. All 213 “no’s” were from Republicans. Eight House members – three Republicans and five Democrats – did not vote.LGBT rights have been a hot-button issue during the 2016 election season. National politics have featured debate over whether making cakes for same-sex couples violates bakers’ religious freedom or whether the government should decide which public bathrooms are used by transgender people.Democrats chanted “shame, shame, shame” at Republicans, drawing attention to the vote. Steny Hoyer, the number two House Democrat, denounced it in a fiery speech. “We had 217 people for non-discrimination right up until the last moment,” he said.Thursday’s emotional vote came hours after the House late on Wednesday passed a $602 billion defense authorization bill that included “religious freedom” language that critics said would allow contractors to discriminate against LGBT individuals.The House Rules committee had angered Democrats by voting along party lines late on Tuesday not to allow a vote on an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would have eliminated that language.Republicans who backed the provision said it was necessary to protect the religious rights of military contractors and not intended to be discriminatory.","Convert the article into a mystery or detective story, building suspense around the events described.","The halls of the U.S. House of Representatives echoed with the cries of ""shame, shame, shame"" on Thursday as a controversial vote unfolded.

"Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi has resigned under pressure from Shiite rebels who seized the capital in September and have confined the embattled leader to his home for the past two days.Presidential officials said Hadi resigned after being pressured to make concessions to the rebels, known as Houthis. He had earlier pledged political concessions in return for the rebels withdrawing from his house and the nearby presidential palace, but Houthi fighters remained deployed around both buildings throughout the day.Military officials close to the president, who like the other officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters, said Hadi resigned after the Houthis pressured him to give a televised speech to calm the streets.State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Thursday that the U.S. is assessing and seeking confirmation of the report.""We are seeking a peaceful transition,"" she said.The Yemeni government also submitted its resignation Thursday.Prime Minister Khaled Bahah's resignation came as the U.N. envoy to the Arab world's poorest country met with representatives from the rebels, known as Houthis and other political factions to try to implement a deal reached Wednesday to end the crisis.Under the agreement, the group's militias were to withdraw from the presidential palace and key areas of the capital they have overrun in recent days in return for political concessions.It remains unclear who really controls the country.Twenty-four hours after signing the deal, heavily armed Shiite rebels remained stationed outside Hadi's house and the presidential palace.Bahah's technocratic government was formed in November as part of a United Nations-brokered peace deal after the Houthis overran the capital in September.Bahah, a political independent, posted his resignation on his official Facebook page, saying he had held office in ""very complicated circumstances."" He says he resigned in order to ""avoid being dragged into an abyss of unconstructive policies based on no law.""""We don't want to be a party to what is happening or will happen,"" he added.In an attempt to end the logjam, U.N. Envoy Jamal Benomar arrived to the country and held a meeting with Houthis and other political factions to push for implementation of the deal.In a brief press conference before the meeting, Benomar told reporters that the deal -- in essence an activation of the previous UN-brokered agreement struck in September when Houthis overran the capital -- is ""the only solution for Yemen.""Yemen's emerging power vacuum has raised fears that the country's dangerous Al Qaeda branch, which claimed the recent attack on a French satirical weekly, will only grow more powerful and popular as the nation slides toward fragmentation and the conflict takes on an increasingly sectarian tone. The Shiite Houthis and the Sunni terror group are sworn enemies.While the capital was free of violence, clashes did erupt southeast of Sanaa between Houthi gunmen and local tribesman. Tribal leaders said two tribesmen and four gunmen allied with Houthi rebels were killed in Khawlan-Watadah, 30 miles from Sanaa.The violence appeared to subside by midday, but a serious flare-up in the region lying along the road to Marib province, an oil-rich area in central Yemen and a haven for Al Qaeda fighters, could torpedo peace efforts.

"More than half of these enrollees are new to the program, said Burwell, speaking at an event commemorating the close of the second open enrollment period for subsidized private health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act's exchange marketplaces. The enrollment total surpasses the Department of Health and Human Services' projections, but is lower than what the Congressional Budget Office expected.""Nearly 11.7 million Americans signed up or were re-enrolled through the marketplace as of Feb. 22,"" Burwell said. ""We are finally moving the needle on reducing the number of uninsured.""""We're confident that we will prevail in the court case argued before the Supreme Court last week. The law is clear,"" Burwell said Monday. ""The text and structure of the Affordable Care Act demonstrate that individuals in every state are eligible for tax credits. Those who support this lawsuit believe that the law should be dismantled or repealed, and they are content to roll back the progress that we have achieved.""Among the estimated 7.7 million enrollees from the federal health insurance exchanges, 87 percent received tax credits worth $263 a month on average, Burwell said. More than half the enrollees paid $100 or less a month, including their subsidies. ""These numbers show just how important the tax credits are to millions of Americans and to the insurance markets in those states and throughout the marketplace,"" she said.Federal officials and most state-run exchanges have allowed individuals with applications in process to complete them for about a week following the deadline. In addition, the federally managed exchanges serving more than 30 states, and the majority of the exchanges operated by 13 states and the District of Columbia, re-opened enrollment for people who learn when they file their income taxes that they owe a fine under the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate that most U.S. residents have health coverage.The numbers Burwell announced Monday are 300,000 higher than those reported by the White House last month. Although additional tax season sign-ups are likely to boost the tally, enrollment is expected to decline over the course of the year as consumers obtain health coverage through another source, like a job, or as they give up their policies and become uninsured.""While we know that the numbers will change as the year continues, we are pleased with the results today,"" Burwell said.The number of sign-ups Burwell announced Monday doesn't reflect how many of those enrollees have begun paying for their insurance policies, which is necessary to secure coverage.

"Turkey Says It Shot Down A Russian Warplane Near Border With SyriaTurkey says that after issuing 10 warnings in five minutes, two of its F-16s shot down a Russian warplane that Turkey claims violated its airspace.On Twitter, Russia's Defense Ministry said its Sukhoi SU-24 was flying ""only within the borders of Syrian territory."" Its pilots, the Russians said, appear to have ejected.Later in the day, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the action a ""stab in the back by the terrorists' accomplices.""According to The Associated Press, Putin went on to say that there would be ""significant consequences.""""We will never tolerate such atrocities as happened today and we hope that the international community will find the strength to join forces and fight this evil,"" Putin said.The AP published video that appears to show a damaged warplane crash into a hillside. The video, shot from Turkey's Hatay province, then appears to show the pilots parachuting down:The Washington Post reports that Russia initially disputed Turkey's version of events, saying the plane was likely downed ""due to shelling from the ground.""Update at 3 p.m. ET: Body Of One Pilot FoundA spokesman for a Syrian rebel group called the 10th Coastal Brigade told NPR's Alison Meuse that it had the body of one of the Russian pilots and also released a video showing the body. The group said the pilot was dead when it found him. He could have been killed in the shoot-down of his jet, when he came under fire during his parachute descent or in a barrage of fire that the rebels laid down to prevent the pilots from heading to a regime-held area nearby.The spokesman said the group does not know the condition or whereabouts of the second pilot. He may have run to regime-held areas.Update at 3:10 p.m. ET: Rebels Say They Downed CopterAnother Syrian rebel group, the First Coastal Division, tells NPR that it destroyed a Russian helicopter that had landed about 7 km from the area where the Russian jet was downed.The helicopter was shot down by a TOW missile provided by a covert U.S. program to support Syrian rebels, according to the media director for the group, which is part of the Free Syrian Army coalition.The media director did not have information on the Russian crew of the helicopter. The group has released a video purporting to show the attack on the helicopter, showing it engulfed in a huge explosion.NATO officials held an extraordinary meeting to discuss the incident. Afterward, NATO's secretary general Jens Stoltenberg released a statement saying, ""We stand in solidarity with Turkey and support the territorial integrity of our NATO ally, Turkey"":The downing of the warplane figured into today's White House meeting between President Obama and French President Francois Hollande, who is trying to shore up support following the recent attacks in Paris.Obama said Turkey had the right to defend its territory. But he also said both sides need to find out what happened and to ""discourage any kind of escalation."" The president added:",Compose the article as a country's new constitution or set of laws inspired by the ideals or challenges presented.,"The recent incident between Turkey and Russia has brought to light the challenges faced by nations in safeguarding their sovereignty and the potential for conflict in a volatile region. It is imperative to examine the events that unfolded and the subsequent reactions to understand the complexities of this complex issue.The Turkish government has asserted that a Russian warplane violated its airspace and was shot down in self-defense. However, Russia maintains that the plane was flying within Syrian territory and that the pilots ejected safely."
"Clinton's campaign, which started raising money for the Democratic National Committee and state Democratic parties this quarter through the Hillary Victory Fund, also raised $18 million in the joint fundraising effort, meaning the campaign raised a total of $55 million for the quarter.In all, the Clinton campaign has raised $112 million for the primary since launching in April. Heading into 2016, the campaign has roughly $38 million cash on hand, according to aides.The haul, which is larger than even some Clinton aides expected, puts a big number on the board that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders -- her main primary challenger -- is unlikely to top.""Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have joined together and powered this historic campaign, we are now heading into Iowa and New Hampshire with the resources we need to be successful,"" Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, said in a statement on Friday.""Helping Democratic candidates win up and down the ticket is a top priority for Hillary Clinton which is why she's also proud to be doing her part to ensure Democrats have the resources we need to win."" CNN reported earlier this week that Clinton raised at least $21 million at fundraisers she personally headlined in the fourth quarter of 2015, a number that almost guaranteed she would break the $100 million goal. The Democratic front-runner headlined a total of 58 fundraisers in the fourth quarter, a pace identical to the 58 events she headlined in the second and third quarters of 2015. The labor-intensive process, which required Clinton to criss-cross the country on both the campaign and fundraising trail, saw the former secretary of state headline fundraisers in 20 states and Washington, D.C. Thirteen events were in New York, the most of any state, and six were in California. The fourth quarter also saw Clinton get more help than usual on the fundraising trail. Former President Bill Clinton headlined dozens of fundraisers in 14 states and Washington, D.C., including events in Texas, Wisconsin and Ohio, during the fourth quarter. While it will be difficult for Sanders to turn in a bigger haul than Clinton, the Vermont senator is expected to bring in a sizable haul, largely buoyed by his strong online contributions. Since launching his campaign, Sanders has solicited over 2.3 million donations and raised over $40 million -- including a sizable $26 million in the third quarter. Aides have said that the campaign is focused on surpassing 1 million donors by the end of the year. Like Clinton, Sanders also signed a joint fundraising effort with the DNC this quarter, starting to raise money for the national party in November. Clinton aides boasted on Friday that 94% of their donations were in increments of $100 or less and more than 60% of donations were from women.

"The 11 service members who were onboard a Black Hawk helicopter that crashed Tuesday night on the Florida panhandle coastline are presumed dead, a Pentagon official said, but a search-and-rescue operation was still underway Wednesday in a desperate search for survivors.Seven Marines and four soldiers were onboard a UH-60 helicopter as part of a training exercise when the chopper ran into heavy fog. Human remains and helicopter parts were recovered earlier Wednesday.""It's a tough day,"" Maj. Gen. Glenn H. Curtis, the adjutant general of the Louisiana National Guard, where the unit was based. ""They're under my command. I take very seriously their safety and well-being, and that of their families.""Kim Urr, 62, who works at the nearby Navarre Beach campground, said she heard a strange sound, followed by two explosions around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday.""It sounded like something metal either being hit or falling over, that's what it sounded like. And there were two booms afterward, similar to what you hear with ordnance booms, but more muffled,"" Urr said.President Obama spoke with the military leaders involved and expressed his condolences to the families before saying he's confident of a detailed and thorough investigation, said his spokesman, Josh Earnest.""Our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families as the search and rescue continues,"" Defense Secretary Ash Carter said on Capitol Hill.The Black Hawk crashed as Marines and National Guardsmen practiced ""insertion and extraction missions,"" using small boats and helicopters to get troops into and out of a target site, said Capt. Barry Morris, spokesman for the Marine Corps Special Operations Command at Camp Lejeune.Like the Army's Green Berets and the Navy's SEALs, these Marines were highly skilled unconventional warriors, trained to endure grueling conditions and sensitive assignments on land and at sea, from seizing ships to special reconnaissance missions and direct action inside hostile territory.The helicopter was part of a nighttime training mission Tuesday at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. There was dense fog in the area at the time of the crash but officials have not said what caused the helicopter to go down.Fog had reduced visibility to less than two miles at the time, according to the National Weather Service. Another helicopter participating in the exercise turned back because of the bad weather before the other Black Hawk crashed, authorities said.Despite the human remains washing ashore, the military still called it a rescue mission Wednesday, said Sara Vidoni, a spokeswoman for Eglin Air Force Base, outside Pensacola.The fog remained so heavy Wednesday that search boats just offshore could be heard but not seen, blasting horns as their crews peered into the choppy water. It finally began to lift in the afternoon, enabling a helicopter to slowly survey the water.About a dozen airmen wearing fatigues walked shoulder-to-shoulder down the beach, scanning the sand, while civilian rescue crews and searchers with dogs joined the effort.The Coast Guard said debris was first spotted about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, and that the search area expanded to a 17-mile stretch of the narrow sound separating Santa Rosa Island from the Florida Panhandle mainland.The Marines were part of a special operations group based in Camp Lejeune. They had arrived Sunday for a week of training.None were immediately identified, so that families could be told first.The helicopter that crashed had joined the training from an airport in nearby Destin.

"Kim Davis — the Rowan County, Kentucky Clerk who earlier today brazenly defied the Supreme Court’s order to issue marriage licenses citing “God’s authority” — has been ordered to stand before U.S. District Judge David Bunning on Thursday and explain why she shouldn’t be jailed and fined for her actions.In a statement released after she refused, for the fourth time, to issue David Moore and David Ermold a marriage license, Davis said that “[t]o issue a marriage license which conflicts with God’s definition of marriage, with my name affixed to the certificate, would violate my conscience. It is not a light issue for me. It is a Heaven or Hell decision.”“I was elected by the people to serve as the County Clerk,” she continued, and “I intend to continue to serve the people of Rowan County, but I cannot violate my conscience.” That she is an elected official has become a point of contention, because as such she can’t be fired for refusing to abide by the Supreme Court’s ruling. Removing her from office would entail impeachment proceedings, which will either have to wait until the next legislative session or require the calling of a special session, which could be prohibitively expensive.In the meantime, no one in Rowan County will be issued a marriage licenses. Lawyers representing the four couples who were denied licenses told the Associated Press that “[s]ince Defendant Davis continues to collect compensation from the Commonwealth for duties she fails to perform,” they want Judge Bunning to “impose financial penalties sufficiently serious and increasingly onerous” — but that they are not seeking for her to be jailed for contempt. The scene at Davis’ office this morning was raucous, with supporters of both side lining the walkway into it and occupying the tiny building. “Praise the Lord!” yelled one, “Stand your ground!” Another demanded Davis “Do your job!” One of her supporters was her husband, who noted that his family has received death threats and warned people that he’s a firm believer in the Second Amendment. “I’m an old redneck hillbilly,” he warned. “That’s all I’ve got to say.

"The poll, conducted from Monday to Friday, showed Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, with a 10.7 point lead among likely voters over Trump, her likely Republican rival in the November presidential election. That's down from a lead of 14.3 points for Clinton on Sunday, the day an American-born shooter who declared allegiance to militant group Islamic State killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.Trump seized on the attack to sharpen his security proposals, saying he would block immigration to the United States from any country with a ""proven history of terrorism"" against America and its allies if elected. The pledge fine-tuned an earlier vow, made after the attacks last year in Paris and California, to ban the entry of all Muslims into the United States.He also called for measures to make it more difficult for suspected terrorists to obtain firearms, veering from the Republican Party's general opposition to gun control.While Trump's comments on both Muslims and guns dismayed some Republican elites, they may have cheered some voters.Some 45 percent of Americans said they supported Trump's idea to suspend Muslim immigration, up from 41.9 percent at the start of the month, according to the poll. Meanwhile, about 70 percent of Americans, including a majority of Democrats and Republicans, said they wanted to see at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns, up from 60 percent in similar polls in 2013 and 2014.Clinton focused her response to the Orlando attack on the need to boost intelligence gathering and defeat Islamic State and what she called ""radical jihadist terrorism,"" while warning against demonizing Muslim-Americans. She also repeated her calls for tougher gun control measures, including a ban on assault weapons.As usual after a major attack, ""terrorism"" jumped to the top concern among all adults in the poll - rising above the economy, health care and other major issues.The poll's five-day average showed that 45.5 percent of likely American voters supported Clinton, while 34.8 percent supported Trump, and another 19.7 percent did not support either candidate. On Sunday, Clinton's support was at 46.6 percent, versus Trump's 32.3 percent.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English with adults living in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii.

"Jindal, a Republican who is considering a presidential run, suggested that politicians like President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton changed their views on gay marriage because of polling indicating more Americans in support of gay marriage.""I'm not one of those politicians,"" Jindal said on CNN's ""New Day."" ""My faith teaches me that marriage is between a man and a woman. I don't believe in discrimination against anybody. I'm not for changing the definition of marriage.""Jindal may be in the minority on the issue when it comes to the issue, but that won't be the case if he joins a crowded Republican primary expected to be full of same-sex opponents, like former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.Huckabee, a staunch social conservative who sought the GOP nomination in 2008, said Monday on CNN suggested he doesn't think he'll be on the ""wrong side of history"" when it comes to same-sex marriage. ""When you say 'the wrong side of history,' let's just be reminded that there's been a relatively, and I mean a very relative brief history of same-sex marriage. The overwhelming history is the natural law of marriage, biblical marriage,"" he said. ""So I don't think there's a side of history that's overwhelming at this point. People have their opinions."" But Huckabee, who's insisted social issues won't be the linchpin of his probable candidacy, argued that the presidential race will be focused on the economy and proposals to combat poverty. Jindal's comments came as he sounded off on the battle over same-sex marriage brewing in neighboring Alabama, where officials in dozens of counties refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples on Monday, the first day in the state's history same-sex couples have been allowed to wed after a federal court ruling overturned the state's ban. Same-sex couples wed in Alabama despite efforts to block them Jindal sidestepped questions about whether county officials should respect the federal ruling and lawfully issue same-sex marriage licenses. Instead, the governor said he hopes the Supreme Court will rule to uphold state's legislative bans on gay marriage when the court rules on the issue by this summer. Louisiana's legislature overwhelmingly amended the state's constitution in 2004 to define marriage solely as the union of a man and a woman. But if the Supreme Court overturns same-sex marriage bans around the country — which it may very likely do — Jindal said the U.S. Congress should pass a constitutional amendment upholding state's same-sex marriage bans, an all-but-impossible endeavor requiring two-thirds support in the House and Senate.","Write a satirical piece, exaggerating the article's themes for comic effect.","The Republican presidential hopeful, Jindal, has sparked a debate with his controversial stance on gay marriage.

"On behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives, I extend my warmest wishes to everyone celebrating Christmas this year.We spend a lot of time this season asking for what we want. But perhaps it would be better to ask for what we need. We have been given so much in this country that it almost seems ungrateful to ask for more. But all of us—at all times—need more of what is good. And this year, I hope that all of us continue to live in what I consider the spirit of Christmas: a courageous humility.It took courage for God to humble Himself. He came down from heaven and became a man—a child in a manger. He did this while knowing that one day He would have to lay down His life for us. He would have to give up His only Son. At first, this might seem like a sad story. But we are to “rejoice in the Lord always.” Christmas is a day of celebration. And it is only through grace and prayer that we come to realize: what a gift He’s given us—what a profound act of love.And so we rejoice. This year, may we continue the spirit of Christmas by facing our flaws fearlessly and by giving back boldly. May we recognize that our way is not the only way—it is not even the right way. It is God’s way we seek. May we cherish all the gifts we have been given—especially the men and women of our armed forces, the people who keep us safe. And may we remember that it takes courage to put others first.

"DoubleLine Capital’s Jeffrey Gundlach said Donald Trump, if he’s elected president, would help the U.S. economy recover by going further into debt, just as Ronald Reagan fueled growth in the 1980s.“Trump is going to win, and Trump is going to increase the deficit,” Gundlach said during a panel discussion Thursday in New York. Reagan “did it by taking three or four decades of stable nonfinancial debt-to-GDP ratio and putting it on a hockey stick higher.”Gundlach, 56, isn’t endorsing any candidate, according to Loren Fleckenstein, a DoubleLine analyst. The fund manager, who has been predicting a Trump election victory since February, noted that Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again,” resembles Reagan’s “Let’s Make America Great Again.”Under Reagan, the U.S. debt grew to more than $2.3 trillion at the end of 1988 from $807 billion eight years earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The total U.S. debt as of Dec. 31 was $15.1 trillion.Markets might not react favorably to a Trump election at first, because the Republican presidential candidate has criticized international trade agreements, according to the fund manager.“First, I think you’re going to get a global growth scare, trade-based,” Gundlach said. “That could cause a market rollover which to me looks like it’s already under way.”This retreat in the S&P 500 Index could be “an excellent buying opportunity,” Gundlach added, as the debt binge “will probably stimulate growth, at least temporarily.”The S&P 500 is down about 0.6 percent since Trump’s victory Tuesday in the Indiana primary. His win prompted his two remaining Republican opponents, Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, to suspend their campaigns.“When I say Donald Trump’s going to win, it’s not that I’m wildly rooting for him, although I don’t dislike Donald Trump,” Gundlach said in an interview with Fox Business Network’s “Wall Street Week” set to air Friday at 8 p.m. New York time. “It’s just like, I think it’s going to happen.”On the panel discussion, Gundlach said oil prices must get to $60 a barrel to avoid a wave of high-yield debt defaults, a price he doesn’t expect to see soon. He predicted more junk-bond defaults when borrowers are forced to roll over debt in a rising interest-rate environment by 2018 or the following two years.Gundlach said he continues to be long on gold. Spot gold was trading at about $1,277 an ounce as of 6:48 p.m. Thursday in New York, up 20 percent this year.

"Updated at 11 a.m. ETFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will officially announce her intention to seek the 2016 Democratic nomination for president on Sunday afternoon, ending years of speculation over her plans to pursue the Oval Office, NPR has learned.People familiar with the campaign plan say that Clinton, long presumed to be the Democratic front-runner even without a formal announcement, will make the announcement possibly via a video and social media, some sources suggest.""So far, Mrs. Clinton faces scant competition for the Democratic nomination. Polls barely register former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley or former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb. One potential heavyweight — Vice President Joe Biden — has said he is considering a campaign but has taken few apparent steps to prepare for one. ""On Thursday, former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee surprisingly joined the field, and offered a biting critique from the left of Mrs. Clinton's record on foreign policy. 'The biggest question will be: What exactly did you accomplish in your four years as secretary of state?' he said in an interview. 'There was a lot of dust in the air. Not many concrete accomplishments.' ""Announcing now gives an edge to Clinton, who lost a bitter contest to then-Sen. Barack Obama for her party's nomination in 2008.

"WASHINGTON — House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday that Senate Democrats should ""get off their ass"" and stop blocking a $40 billion Homeland Security bill that would derail President Obama's immigration programs.Boehner's comments came a day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the Senate has reached a stalemate and ""the next move obviously is up to the House."" Senate Democrats voted three times last week to block the DHS funding bill from moving forward. They object to House-passed provisions that would cut off all funds to carry out Obama's executive orders on immigration.The two Republican leaders seem to be each placing responsibility on the other chamber for what happens next on the funding bill. Unless Congress acts, funding for the Department of Homeland Security will expire on Feb. 27 and the agency will face a partial shutdown.Boehner said the House will not take up a revised bill despite the Senate impasse.""The House has done its job,"" Boehner, R-Ohio, said at a news conference after meeting with House Republicans. ""Why don't you go ask the Senate Democrats when they're going to get off their ass and do something other than to vote 'no'?""Obama announced in November that he would protect about 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation and allow them to work legally in the U.S. His program would help the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens. It also would expand his 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which gives temporary legal status and work permits to undocumented immigrants brought to the USA as children.The House-passed bill would cut off all funding for the 2012 DACA program as well as blocking funds for Obama's latest immigration orders. Senate Democrats say they will only support the DHS funding bill if the immigration provisions are scrapped.""If Congress wants stronger border security and immigration enforcement, a clean funding bill for DHS is what we should be rallying around,"" said Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., the senior Democrat on the Senate homeland security committee. ""I hope that Congress can come together to do the right thing — support the passage of a clean, full-year appropriation for the Department of Homeland Security by Feb. 27 — and then get to work to pass a thoughtful, comprehensive immigration reform bill.""Republicans see Obama's immigration orders as an unconstitutional power grab and view the DHS funding bill as the best leverage they have to stop them. But Senate Republicans, who have a 54-vote majority, need 60 votes to advance the DHS funding bill and they have been unable to attract any Democrats to their side.Boehner and McConnell have both said they don't want a shutdown of Homeland Security, but their options are running out.There has been talk in both chambers of the possibility of passing a continuing resolution that would keep DHS open and funded at 2014 levels. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has spoken out against that option because it would not allow DHS to hire new Secret Service agents, buy new surveillance equipment for the Southwest border or send certain security grants to states and local governments.",Convert into a dialogue between two people with opposing views on the subject.,"**Boehner:** ""The Senate Democrats should get off their ass and stop blocking this bill. It's time to pass a bill and put this issue to bed.""**Carper:** ""We're not going to support a bill that cuts off all funding for DACA and Obama's latest immigration orders. If Congress wants to address immigration, it should do so through a comprehensive reform bill, not by passing a bill that would punish undocumented immigrants."""

"There’s a conceit that says everything at Facebook is run by data, not people. And we prefer it that way.For the site’s billion users, believing there’s no human puppet master behind the scenes makes its growing control over life more palatable. It’s just a clever machine, reflecting our desires better and better with every interaction, right? For news producers, we have to believe that the platform treats everyone equally: that it’s a publisher not an editor.In retrospect, this was always naive.A conservative whistleblower at Facebook yesterday claimed in a report that the influential “trending news” tab was deliberately biased toward liberal news – something the social network denies.“I’d come on shift and I’d discover that CPAC [Conservative Political Action Conference] or Mitt Romney or Glenn Beck or popular conservative topics wouldn’t be trending because either the curator didn’t recognize the news topic or it was like they had a bias against Ted Cruz,” the former news curator told the tech blog Gizmodo.Silicon Valley loves using the word algorithm to cover the word judgment, but any platform built by humans is always political. The engineers building the products want to skew them toward “quality” content, but it’s hard to determine what quality is, exactly, without making a choice influenced by values.When I read suggestions that Facebook might be skewing its trending bar, my first reaction, as a San Francisco liberal, was to be slightly pleased (any help we can get against Trump, right?). But what if the tables were turned? “I wonder what the psychological effects of it are,” said Vince Coglianese, editor of the conservative news site The Daily Caller. “Millions of Facebook users now have no idea that the things they’re concerned about are the concerns of a lot of people. It’s scary to think Facebook’s intentionally isolating vast swaths of the country.”Facebook’s in a tricky spot because curation is necessary. Truly viral news content tends to be terrible. The front page of Reddit’s ‘”hot” section, an imperfect but useful barometer for the viral stories of the day, currently has headlines like: “Chameleon unsure bug is food or not” and “These condoms are around 60 years old. (found in my basement)”. Meanwhile my Facebook trending bar has: “Federal Trade Commission: Judge Rules Against Agency’s Bid to Block Health Care Systems Merger”. It’s probably fair to assume that the FTC news was not going as viral as that old condom, but a Facebook employee decided it was more important.Facebook is the dominant player in the media today. As news websites lose relevance to readers who find content socially, and as stories are published directly onto Facebook as Instant articles, the company’s power will only grow. To turn Facebook’s trending bar into a Reddit page is not the answer. But Facebook has to be more honest about how it operates as an editor.“Just be transparent about how the words on the screen are getting there,” Coglianese said.If there’s one thing Silicon Valley loves more than the conceit of an amoral algorithm, it is secrecy. And as a social network with a newsfeed of vacation pictures, Facebook could get away with being secretive about their curation.As the most powerful publisher and now editor in the world today, Facebook owes it to its billion users to be clear about how the site plans on distributing news.","Propose as a community project plan, inspired by solutions mentioned or implied in the text.","**Community Project Plan:****Objective:*** Raise awareness about the potential bias of Facebook's ""trending news"" tab.* Discuss the implications of this bias for different user groups.* Advocate for increased transparency from Facebook regarding its curation practices.**Activities:**1. **Education and Awareness:**   - Create a"

"Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., announced today that he will seek the 2016 GOP presidential nomination.""I have a message — a message that is loud and clear and does not mince words,"" he told supporters in Louisville, Ky. ""We've come to take our country back.""Earlier, in a statement on his website, he said: ""I am running for president to return our country to the principles of liberty and limited government.""Paul also released a video with the opening line: ""On April 7, a different kind of Republican will take on Washington.""Paul faces what is likely to be a crowded Republican field for 2016. Although Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, his colleague in the Senate, is the only other prominent Republican to have announced his intention to run for president, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Scott Walker of Wisconsin, as well as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, are expected to join the fray.Polls show Paul in a three-way tie for third place in the race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Bush and Walker lead the most recent average of polls.Paul, the son of longtime libertarian Republican Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010 in the Tea Party wave. An ophthalmologist by training, Rand Paul is pitching himself as a ""different kind of Republican."" When he was first elected, he was seen as a candidate whose libertarian ideas, in the words of The Washington Post, ""could make him the most unusual and intriguing voice among the major contenders in the 2016 field."" It adds:As he prepared to announce his presidential ambitions, Paul adopted a more muscular defense policy and reached out to religious conservatives. (For more on the former, you can listen to Paul's interview with NPR's Robert Siegel last September.) Nick Gillespie, editor in chief of Reason.com and Reason TV, told NPR's Scott Simon in a recent interview that Paul could be called ""libertarian-ish.""""You know, I think he is talking what he believes. But I think he draws a lot of ideas from his father generally without some of the baggage, to be honest. ""And people are more interested, I think, now than even a few years ago of being allowed to make more choices that are important in their lives.

"WASHINGTON, June 21 (Reuters) - Tensions are building inside and outside the white marble facade of the U.S. Supreme Court building as the nine justices prepare to issue major rulings on gay marriage and President Barack Obama's healthcare law by the end of the month.Of the 11 cases left to decide, the biggest are a challenge by gay couples to state laws banning same-sex marriage and a conservative challenge to subsidies provided under the Obamacare law to help low- and middle-income people buy health insurance that could lead to millions of people losing medical coverage.Many legal experts predict the court will legalize gay marriage nationwide by finding that the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of equal treatment under the law and due process prohibit states from banning same-sex nuptials.In three key decisions since 1996, Kennedy has broadened the court's view of equality for gays. The most recent was a 2013 case in which the court struck down a federal law denying benefits to married same-sex couples.During oral arguments in the gay marriage case on April 28, Kennedy posed tough questions to lawyers from both sides but stressed the nobility and dignity of same-sex couples.The healthcare decision is tougher to call. Chief Justice John Roberts, the swing vote when the court upheld Obamacare in 2012, said little during the March 4 oral argument to indicate how he will vote.The court will issue some rulings on Monday, with more likely later in the week.For the justices, the pressure is on to have the rulings ready. That can be difficult as the cases in which they are closely divided are generally the ones left until the end.James Obergefell, one of the plaintiffs in the gay marriage case, said he will be at the court for all the remaining decision days.Obergefell sued Ohio, challenging its ban on same-sex marriages, after the state refused to acknowledge his marriage to John Arthur on Arthur's death certificate. They were married in Maryland, a state that allows gay marriages, just months before Arthur died in 2013.The Supreme Court does not announce in advance which rulings will be issued on any given day.""It's nerve-racking, it's exciting, but it's also scary,"" Obergefell said while waiting in line to enter the courtroom on Thursday.On the other side of the issue, the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian group that opposes gay marriage, will have at least two attorneys in the courtroom, spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.As for the closed-door deliberations at the court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg hinted during a June 12 speech at the turmoil to come. ""Sharp divisions, one can confidently predict, will rise in the term's final weeks,"" Ginsburg said.Prior to June 15, the court was split 5-4 in only seven of the 46 cases decided at that point. But last week alone, four of the nine rulings were 5-4 decisions. In the rulings, several justices wrote separate opinions in which they aimed pointed comments at their colleagues.","Reframe the text as a magic spell or incantation, weaving the story's elements into a mystical formula.","In the name of the Supreme Court, I cast this spell,To bring justice to all, as the clock strikes the bell.With the power of the Constitution,I summon the spirit of equality,To strike down discrimination,And protect the rights of all human beings.Oh, mighty Court, hear my plea,For the sake of love, let us set you free.From the shackles of injustice,May you free the"
"Why are Americans expected to die sooner than their peers in other high-income countries?A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association takes a look at the question. The results are, well, not too surprising — three of the big drivers for the year analyzed, 2012, were guns, drugs, and cars.The study looked at these causes of injury deaths, which are the three biggest causes of injury death in the US and altogether account for more than 100,000 early deaths each year in America. It compared how common these deaths are in the US versus other high-income countries — the UK, Denmark, Sweden, Japan, and eight others — with 2012 data from the US National Vital Statistics System and the World Health Organization Mortality Database.It found that, on average, men and women in the other high-income countries can expect to live about 2.2 years longer than men and women in the US — and guns, drugs, and cars played a prominent role.Among men, gun deaths explained 21 percent of the gap, drug overdoses 14 percent, and car crashes 13 percent. And among women, gun deaths explained 4 percent, drug overdoses 9 percent, and car crashes 6 percent.In total, the death rate for guns, drugs, and cars was much, much higher in the US than its developed peers, as this chart shows:""Although the reasons for the gap in life expectancy at birth between the United States and comparable countries are complex,"" study authors Andrew Fenelon, Li-Hui Chen, and Susan Baker wrote, ""a substantial portion of this gap reflects just three causes of injury.""So why do Americans die more from these causes? There are cultural factors, but bad policy plays a role too.With guns, the research shows that America's unusually high levels of gun ownership lead to more gun violence. Other factors, such as socioeconomic issues, contribute to violence, but guns are the one issue that makes America unique relative to other developed countries in comparable socioeconomic circumstances. (To learn more about America's gun problem, read Vox's explainer.)""A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,"" UC Berkeley's Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins wrote in a breakthrough analysis in 1999. ""A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.""Some research also shows tightening existing gun control measures in the US would help: Studies in both Connecticut and Missouri suggested that gun licensing laws in those states helped reduce homicides and suicides.With drugs, America is now in the middle of a harrowing opioid and heroin epidemic that's killing tens of thousands of people each year. (For an in-depth dive on this topic, read Vox's explainer.)Academic analyses of the crisis have concluded that the US was too slow to respond to misleading advertising campaigns from opioid producers, in which they claimed that their drugs were safe and effective. Americans have suffered the consequences, getting addicted to and dying from opioid painkillers and heroin as pharmaceutical companies have massively profited.With cars, by the 1960s European policies began encouraging walking, cycling, and public transportation. The US, meanwhile, continued to encourage sprawl and driving. The result: Americans drive much more than their European peers, and are more likely to die in crashes as a result. (To learn more about US and European transportation policy, read Ralph Buehler's great explainer at the Atlantic's CityLab.)Even perfect policies might not fix all of these problems — Americans, after all, love their guns, drugs, and cars, and that cultural preference will likely remain strong for some time. But better policies could push the US in the right direction — and save lives.","Frame as an investigative report, digging deeper into the article's implications.",The study found that the gap in life expectancy at birth between the US and comparable countries is largely explained by these three causes of injury death.The study found that gun deaths explained 21% of the gap among men and 4% among women. Drug overdoses explained 14% of the gap among men and
"Protesters in Arizona briefly blocked access to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s rally Saturday morning in Arizona, kicking off a full day of campaign events in the border state, which holds key primaries Tuesday.The protesters blocked a highway leading to Trump’s outdoor rally in Fountain Hills, Arizona, near Scottsdale, before sheriff's deputies removed them and towed their vehicles.“We’re not going to let demonstrators intimidate this forum and this sheriff. Now we’re going to have a nice, nice rally for Donald Trump,” said Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who led the effort to remove the demonstrators and who has endorsed the GOP front-runner.Arizona has long been ground-zero for the politically-charged illegal immigration debate, with roughly 368 miles of border with Mexico and more border fence than any other state.Roughly 30 percent of Arizona’s population is Hispanic. And in 2010, the state passed one of the strictest anti-immigration laws in American history.“So much crime and drugs passing through the border. You know what? We’re going to build a wall, and we’re going to stop it,” Trump said at the rally, returning to his early and oft-repeated campaign promise to build a wall along the southern border and have Mexico pay for it.Arpaio – the self-described “America’s toughest sheriff” – said at least 10,000 people were kept waiting in the Arizona heat for about an hour as a result of the roadblock, which resulted in three arrests.Trump supporters and protesters exchanged words at the rally, but there were no initial reports of physical violence.Trump, who early in his campaign visited the border, leads the GOP field in Arizona with 34 percent of the vote, followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 21 percent and Ohio Gov. John Kasich at 13 percent.Trump held a larger rally later Saturday at the Phoenix Convention Center.Trump said protesters at his rally are ""taking away our First Amendment rights"" and vowed to take the country back if he's elected president.He called one protester at his Phoenix rally, who wore the Klu Klux Klan hood, ""disgusting."" Another group, carrying a ""Black Lives Matter"" sign were also kicked out.The rallies and protest follow a local border patrol union of Friday supporting Trump.Local 2544 said Trump asked for the endorsement and that officials responded by saying he is the only 2016 White House candidate to “publicly expressed his support” of the Border Patrol’s mission and it agents and that he has been “an outspoken candidate” on the need for a secure border.However, Art Del Cueto, president of the Tucson-based union, made clear that he would adhere to the larger National Border Patrol Council’s practice of not endorsing presidential candidates.The Supreme Court later upheld the most controversial part of Arizona’s 2010 law -- commonly referred to S.B. 1070 and that allows police to try to determine the immigration status of anybody arrested or detained if they have “reasonable suspicion” the suspect is in the U.S. illegally.However, the law also sparked widespread opposition including businesses threatening to leave the state.Trump and Cruz essentially call for those living illegally in the United States to return to their home country, while Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders want to allow them to stay.Several thousand miles away in New York, demonstrators also took to the streets to protest the Republican presidential hopeful.The protesters gathered Saturday in Manhattan's Columbus Circle, across from Central Park, with a heavy police presence. Demonstrators chanted: ""Donald Trump, go away, racist, sexist, anti-gay.""They marched across south Central Park to Trump Tower, the Fifth Avenue skyscraper where Trump lives.

Williams is from the St. Louis area and had been on probation for receiving stolen property.Williams had been involved in protests on the evening that the shooting occurred and had ""acknowledged"" firing shots, according to McCulloch. McCulloch said that Williams, who is African-American, may have been firing at someone other than the police.""We don't know him,"" said Tony Rice, the founder of Ground Level Support, who has been protesting since AugustAfter naming three young male protesters who were regularly at the demonstrations, Rice told HuffPost, ""I don't think there is a male 20-years-old that regularly protest outside of them.""""I think I can speak for the protester community in saying we don't know him,"" said Rice.After the press conference, press swarmed Alicia Street when she helped source the first picture of Williams. Street, 29, has been actively involved in protest since August as well and says she was unfamiliar with Williams as well.""I have never seen him at a protest. I cannot recall that I even seen him that night. We know a lot of people out there, we really do. I even showed pictures to other regular protesters and they said they didn't know him,"" Street told HuffPost.The shooting came during protests after Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson announced that he would resign. One of the officers was shot in the face and the other was shot in the shoulder, but both survived the attack.Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement on Sunday that the arrest was a testament to good collaboration between federal and local authorities.“This arrest sends a clear message that acts of violence against our law enforcement personnel will never be tolerated. The swiftness of this action is a credit to the significant cooperation between federal authorities and the St. Louis County Police Department,"" Holder said. ""The ATF’s ballistic imaging technology has played a critical role in the ongoing investigation. I commend both the ATF and St. Louis police for their tremendous work in identifying this suspect.""President Barack Obama condemned the shooting on Thursday, posting on Twitter that ""violence against police is unacceptable.""

"One of two crew members survived the shooting down of a Russian warplane by Turkey on Tuesday, Russian officials say, and was rescued by a Syrian commando unit in an operation that ended early Wednesday.The news comes as international tensions continue to rise over the incident. As we reported Tuesday, Turkey says the Russian Su-24 fighter jet was in Turkish airspace when it was shot down by Turkish F-16s. Turkey says it warned the Russian warplane 10 times before taking action.Russia maintains the jet was flying over Syria at the time.Both Russian crew members appeared to eject from the jet and parachute to the ground, but one was reportedly found dead Tuesday by a Syrian rebel group.Russia now says the other crew member has been rescued. It was a costly mission for Russia, NPR's Corey Flintoff reports for our Newscast unit:""Russia's defense minister said the pilot was rescued in a 12-hour operation that ended in the early hours of the morning. ""Rebel fighters in the area claim they shot one of the Russian helicopters involved in the search yesterday and then used a missile to destroy it on the ground after it was forced to land. ""Russia says one of the helicopter crewmen was killed, but the rest were evacuated safely.""Meanwhile, Russia and Turkey continue to exchange angry rhetoric while at the same time calling for military restraint.Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Wednesday that Russia could not justify its attacks on ethnic Turks in Syria under the pretext of fighting the Islamic State, and reiterated statements by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that Turkey will continue to defend its airspace.But, Davutoglu said, targeting Russia is ""out of the question,"" Reuters reports.Also on Wednesday, Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, called the shooting of the plane a ""planned provocation"" that is prompting Moscow to ""reconsider relations with Ankara,"" The Associated Press reports. On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the shooting a ""stab in the back.""But Lavrov says Moscow has ""no intention to go to war with Turkey,"" the AP writes.Russia says it is deploying an advanced anti-aircraft system to its base in Syria.

"What the West really needs to take on the Islamic State is ... a jobs program.That's what a top State Department spokeswoman suggested when asked in a TV interview Monday night about what the U.S.-led coalition is doing to stop the slaughter of civilians by Islamic State militants across the region.""We're killing a lot of them, and we're going to keep killing more of them. ... But we cannot win this war by killing them,"" department spokeswoman Marie Harf said on MSNBC's ""Hardball."" ""We need ... to go after the root causes that leads people to join these groups, whether it's lack of opportunity for jobs, whether --""At that point, Harf was interrupted by host Chris Matthews, who pointed out, ""There's always going to be poor people. There's always going to be poor Muslims.""Harf continued to argue that the U.S. should work with other countries to ""help improve their governance"" and ""help them build their economies so they can have job opportunities for these people.""She acknowledged there's ""no easy solution"" and said the U.S. would still take out ISIS leaders. But Harf said: ""If we can help countries work at the root causes of this -- what makes these 17-year-old kids pick up an AK-47 instead of trying to start a business?""Asked about Harf's remarks on Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Harf was only making the point that fighting ISIS entails more than just a military solution.The comments come as the Obama administration takes heat from lawmakers for its approach to the Islamic State, whose self-proclaimed fighters in Libya recently executed 21 Coptic Christians from Egypt.The White House on Tuesday kicked off a three-day summit on ""countering violent extremism."" It began with Vice President Biden moderating a discussion on countering extremism with representatives from cities.This, though, follows a pattern of conferences and summits called by the administration to address urgent challenges. The administration is facing criticism for this approach -- and for describing the summit in general terms -- at a time when Islamic State militants are spreading, recruiting and executing prisoners from multiple countries in increasingly brutal ways.""The White House had to seem like it was doing something,"" said Jonah Goldberg, a National Review editor and conservative columnist, while claiming the summit won't achieve much.Senior administration officials, though, defended the conference, and their description of it, on a call with reporters.Asked whether Islamic extremists are in fact the focus of the summit, one official said extremism has spanned ""many decades"" and taken on ""many forms,"" but they recognize that those launching recent attacks ""are calling themselves Muslims.""""You can call them what you want. We're calling them terrorists,"" the official said.The New York Times reported Tuesday that as airstrikes continue in Iraq and Syria, the administration is boosting efforts to counter ISIS on social media. The plan centers around a small State Department agency that pushes against ISIS and other groups' online propaganda.""We're getting beaten on volume, so the only way to compete is by aggregating, curating and amplifying existing content,"" Richard Stengel, under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs, told the Times.Officials reportedly plan to describe some of their social media strategy at the three-day counter-extremism summit.","Write a satirical piece, exaggerating the article's themes for comic effect.","""We need to go after the root causes that leads people to join these groups, whether it's lack of opportunity for jobs or whether it's the allure of violence,"" Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said on MSNBC's ""Hardball.""It seems that the West has a real problem with the Islamic State, and the only way"

"Turkey Says It Shot Down A Russian Warplane Near Border With SyriaTurkey says that after issuing 10 warnings in five minutes, two of its F-16s shot down a Russian warplane that Turkey claims violated its airspace.On Twitter, Russia's Defense Ministry said its Sukhoi SU-24 was flying ""only within the borders of Syrian territory."" Its pilots, the Russians said, appear to have ejected.Later in the day, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the action a ""stab in the back by the terrorists' accomplices.""According to The Associated Press, Putin went on to say that there would be ""significant consequences.""""We will never tolerate such atrocities as happened today and we hope that the international community will find the strength to join forces and fight this evil,"" Putin said.The AP published video that appears to show a damaged warplane crash into a hillside. The video, shot from Turkey's Hatay province, then appears to show the pilots parachuting down:The Washington Post reports that Russia initially disputed Turkey's version of events, saying the plane was likely downed ""due to shelling from the ground.""Update at 3 p.m. ET: Body Of One Pilot FoundA spokesman for a Syrian rebel group called the 10th Coastal Brigade told NPR's Alison Meuse that it had the body of one of the Russian pilots and also released a video showing the body. The group said the pilot was dead when it found him. He could have been killed in the shoot-down of his jet, when he came under fire during his parachute descent or in a barrage of fire that the rebels laid down to prevent the pilots from heading to a regime-held area nearby.The spokesman said the group does not know the condition or whereabouts of the second pilot. He may have run to regime-held areas.Update at 3:10 p.m. ET: Rebels Say They Downed CopterAnother Syrian rebel group, the First Coastal Division, tells NPR that it destroyed a Russian helicopter that had landed about 7 km from the area where the Russian jet was downed.The helicopter was shot down by a TOW missile provided by a covert U.S. program to support Syrian rebels, according to the media director for the group, which is part of the Free Syrian Army coalition.The media director did not have information on the Russian crew of the helicopter. The group has released a video purporting to show the attack on the helicopter, showing it engulfed in a huge explosion.NATO officials held an extraordinary meeting to discuss the incident. Afterward, NATO's secretary general Jens Stoltenberg released a statement saying, ""We stand in solidarity with Turkey and support the territorial integrity of our NATO ally, Turkey"":The downing of the warplane figured into today's White House meeting between President Obama and French President Francois Hollande, who is trying to shore up support following the recent attacks in Paris.Obama said Turkey had the right to defend its territory.

"North Charleston Police Officer Michael T. Slager, 33, can be seen shooting 50-year-old Walter Scott after a confrontation on Saturday, according to The Post and Courier. Slager chases Scott and shoots at him eight times in the video recorded by a passerby and obtained by The New York Times.The confrontation started when Slager had reportedly pulled over Scott because of a broken taillight. It escalated into a foot chase as Scott allegedly fled because there were family court-issued warrants for his arrest. Slager pursued Scott into a grassy lot and claimed that he fired his Taser to subdue him.Earlier this week, an attorney for Slager said the cop felt threatened after Scott tried to overpower him and take his Taser. Today that attorney told The Post and Courier that he's ""no longer involved"" in the case.But first images in the video are of Slager shooting at Scott as he runs away from him. It also appears that Slager drops the Taser near Scott after he was gunned down, according to The New York Times.Police reports also say that responding officers performed CPR and delivered medical aid to Scott, but the video shows Scott face down in handcuffs for several minutes after the shooting. Another officer shows up and appears to give Scott aid, but never performs CPR.Police Chief Eddie Driggers said Tuesday that Slager had been arrested. The U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement that FBI investigators would work with the State Law Enforcement Division, which typically investigates officer-involved shootings in South Carolina, and the state’s attorney general to investigate any civil rights violations in Scott’s death. Mayor Keith Summey added during a news conference that as a result of the video and Slager’s “bad decision,” the officer would be charged with murder.Scott had been arrested about 10 times in the past, mostly for failing to pay child support or show up for hearings, according to the paper.""He has four children, he doesn’t have some type of big violent past or arrest record. He had a job, he was engaged,"" a lawyer for Scott's family told the Times. ""He had back child support and didn’t want to go to jail for back child support.""In a statement released Tuesday night, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley (R) said, ""What happened in this case is not acceptable in South Carolina."" Senator Tim Scott (R) said ""The senseless shooting and taking of Walter Scott's life was absolutely unnecessary and avoidable,"" adding that he would be watching the case closely.The shooting in North Charleston comes on the heels of several high-profile cases of police officers using deadly force against unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, Cleveland and New York. This is one of the few times the offending officer has been charged with murder.""What if there was no video? What if there was no witness? Where would we be without that video,"" Justin Bamberg said at a presser with the family on Tuesday night. Bamburg is one of the Scotts' family attorneys and also represents South Carolina's House District 90.Family attorney L. Chris Stewart called the witness who recorded the video a ""hero,"" saying that video evidence disproved initial reports that Scott reached for the Slager's Taser. Stewart added that the witness is working with investigators and may eventually come forward.""If there was no video, I do not believe that officer would be in jail,"" Bamberg said. ""From what the video shows, I think that provides the necessary ammunition to hold this officer accountable.""""I don't think anybody can see that and not see that what that officer did was murder Mr. Scott in cold blood,"" Bamberg said. ""What would have happened if this witness did not have the courage to stand up and do the right thing and decide that what he witnessed was wrong? I'm glad we don't have to ponder that.""","Craft as a movie synopsis, including character arcs and plot twists.","Slager is a tragic case that has sparked outrage and calls for justice.

"Say what you will about Donald Trump, but the man is winner. Trump didn’t just wallop his opponents Tuesday — he crushed them. Up 41 percent in Delaware, 40 percent in Rhode Island, 37 percent in Pennsylvania, 33 percent in Maryland, 30 percent in Connecticut, he’s estimated to have won 110 delegates, versus five for Kasich and three for Cruz.If the race for the GOP nomination were a Little League game, the mercy rule would be imposed.Here’s where we stand today. Ted Cruz is mathematically eliminated from winning the Republican nomination before the convention in Cleveland. John Kasich has now won a single state — Ohio — where he is governor. If ever there were a series of states that would at least theoretically be fertile territory for him, it would be the Northeast, home of the last vestiges of Republican moderates. Yet, he didn’t crack 30 percent anywhere. Republicans can talk all they want about Never Trump and trying to stop him at the RNC in Cleveland. They can talk about changing the rules and holding out hope that a white knight candidate will emerge. It isn’t going to happen. Either Trump is the nominee or he’ll burn the whole thing to the ground. If you’re a gambler, go all in on the former.It is worth stepping back, however, and noting that Trump’s hammerlock over the party — and his ascendancy within the GOP — is astounding. He’s a political amateur who never held elected office; he’s a xenophobe, a bully, and a misogynist and he has run directly against the leadership of the party he hopes to lead. Yet, today he stands on the cusp of winning the nomination of the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Nixon, and Reagan. I know we’ve all become inured to Trump’s insults, his know-nothingness, and his crudeness, but it can’t be said enough — truly we are living in a political moment unlike anything that any of us has seen before.Here’s what might be even more amazing: Trump’s position as the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party is not the most remarkable political event this year. Rather, it’s that the Democratic Party is poised to nominate the first woman to be a major party candidate for president. Somehow this constantly seems to be forgotten; and whether you like Hillary Clinton or despise her, that America is poised to nominate a woman for president is a big deal.Tuesday night, Clinton racked up four more primary wins, including the delegate-rich states of Maryland and Pennsylvania. Only in Rhode Island did Bernie Sanders thwart her. Early on in the evening, before all the races had been called, he gave a “victory” speech in West Virginia that not only left unmentioned the evening’s results, but plowed forward with confidence about the road ahead. It’s a fitting metaphor for the Sanders campaign, which increasingly seems to operate in a realm completely divorced from reality. Sanders cannot and will not win the Democratic nomination. Period.Indeed, in her victory speech, Clinton — as she has increasingly done — simply ignored Sanders. Instead she aimed her daggers at her real target, Donald Trump. The Democratic race will continue, but for all intents and purposes, it is over. Clinton can now begin her pivot to the general election, and Sanders can play out the string.What we now with some certainty is that we’re only a few months away from an historic, unprecedented presidential campaign — and no matter which candidate wins on Election Day, history will be made.","Reimagine the article as a speculative fiction story, incorporating futuristic elements or technology.","The year is 2024. The political landscape is shifting like a sandstorm, and the world is on the brink of a historic election. Donald Trump, a political force of both controversy and admiration, has surged ahead in the Republican primary, leaving his opponents in the dust.In a race that has captivated the nation, Trump has not only won the hearts of many but also the delegate-rich states of Delaware, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Maryland,"
"It seems almost quaint, really, to go back to the start of this presidential campaign when the question du jour was whether Chris ""just-sit-down-and-shut-up"" Christie was too much of a bully to become president. Temperament, it seems, was a requirement.Or even go back to Hillary Clinton's 2008 derision of Barack Obama as not ready to be president and take that 3 a.m. phone call about a national security crisis. Experience and depth of knowledge was also an issue.But that's ancient history. Somehow, the notions of temperament and experience have been overtaken by the desire -- at least according to the polls so far in the GOP race -- for what passes as a show of strength, unbound by convention and unattached to complexity. Donald Trump, the undisputed frontrunner, reigns supreme, no matter what the half-formed solutions. As in: Muslims are trying to kill us, so let's keep them out. Illegal immigrants are ""raping"" and taking our jobs, so let's keep them out. Civility -- now called political correctness -- is ruining our national conversation, so let's abandon it.The cliché is that presidential elections are about change, and that's true. Only this one may be about sea-change.This is not something that comes from nowhere, out of the blue. Americans are, with good reason, truly afraid. According to our CNN polling , nearly two thirds believe an act of terrorism is likely in the homeland -- and that poll was taken before the carnage of San Bernardino. Eighty-one percent are convinced that the terrorists are here, living among us -- a completely rational conclusion.Even more important -- and here's the key to Donald Trump's kingdom -- voters believe the political system, including (and maybe most of all) the President, have completely and utterly failed to get a handle on, or even appear to have a strategy for, security. And why would anybody blame anyone for thinking that? Sixty-eight percent say America's response to ISIS has not been tough enough, and a slightly smaller number say that when we do take action (in Iraq and Syria,) we fail. And that's not just among Republicans: Majorities in both parties say the United States has been ineffective in its response to the terror threat. This is not a new storyline. So this particular election-year story has all of the following: Disaffected and frustrated voters. Ineffective president. A level of public fear that has been rising steadily for at least a handful of years. Throw in anger at the collapsing political system, the establishment and the media, and Trump appears onstage like a vision emerging out of the clouds: the dark knight of our politics. Donald Trump is no fool. He's an experienced opportunist. He knows full well that he has stepped into a leadership vacuum that exists in American politics, and has been around for some time: Why should the American public have any respect at all for its institutions when they have been failing? When Congress can't legislate, or even behave? When the President -- elected with such high hopes -- fails to inspire or connect or even explain strategy? When others running for president often look like they're made of the same torn fabric, just with different holes? Trump flouts the conventions, and plays to fears. But for now, at least, it doesn't matter. In a large field of GOP candidates, Trump's solid core of support among one-third of Republicans -- a minority -- is enough to keep him on top, and any Republican running would like to have his numbers. His latest gambit -- a vague proposal to keep Muslims out of the country until ""our country's representatives can figure out what's going on"" is pure bombast, delivered to rally the faithful -- and he'll probably get a bump in the polls out of it. Jeb Bush calls it ""unhinged."" His fellow Republicans also punch at it, to varying degrees. But, for now at least, they're just punching jello. And hoping he doesn't break the mold.","Translate the text into a visual infographic, summarizing key facts and figures in a graphical format.",****Infographic Summary of Key Facts and Figures:****Public Fear:**- 66% believe an act of terrorism is likely in the homeland.- 81% are convinced that terrorists are living among us.**Disaffected and Frustrated Voters:**- Majorities in both parties say the United States has been ineffective in its response to the terror threat.- 68% say America's response to ISIS has not

"Protesters in Arizona briefly blocked access to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s rally Saturday morning in Arizona, kicking off a full day of campaign events in the border state, which holds key primaries Tuesday.The protesters blocked a highway leading to Trump’s outdoor rally in Fountain Hills, Arizona, near Scottsdale, before sheriff's deputies removed them and towed their vehicles.“We’re not going to let demonstrators intimidate this forum and this sheriff. Now we’re going to have a nice, nice rally for Donald Trump,” said Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who led the effort to remove the demonstrators and who has endorsed the GOP front-runner.Arizona has long been ground-zero for the politically-charged illegal immigration debate, with roughly 368 miles of border with Mexico and more border fence than any other state.Roughly 30 percent of Arizona’s population is Hispanic. And in 2010, the state passed one of the strictest anti-immigration laws in American history.“So much crime and drugs passing through the border. You know what? We’re going to build a wall, and we’re going to stop it,” Trump said at the rally, returning to his early and oft-repeated campaign promise to build a wall along the southern border and have Mexico pay for it.Arpaio – the self-described “America’s toughest sheriff” – said at least 10,000 people were kept waiting in the Arizona heat for about an hour as a result of the roadblock, which resulted in three arrests.Trump supporters and protesters exchanged words at the rally, but there were no initial reports of physical violence.Trump, who early in his campaign visited the border, leads the GOP field in Arizona with 34 percent of the vote, followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 21 percent and Ohio Gov. John Kasich at 13 percent.Trump held a larger rally later Saturday at the Phoenix Convention Center.Trump said protesters at his rally are ""taking away our First Amendment rights"" and vowed to take the country back if he's elected president.He called one protester at his Phoenix rally, who wore the Klu Klux Klan hood, ""disgusting."" Another group, carrying a ""Black Lives Matter"" sign were also kicked out.The rallies and protest follow a local border patrol union of Friday supporting Trump.Local 2544 said Trump asked for the endorsement and that officials responded by saying he is the only 2016 White House candidate to “publicly expressed his support” of the Border Patrol’s mission and it agents and that he has been “an outspoken candidate” on the need for a secure border.However, Art Del Cueto, president of the Tucson-based union, made clear that he would adhere to the larger National Border Patrol Council’s practice of not endorsing presidential candidates.The Supreme Court later upheld the most controversial part of Arizona’s 2010 law -- commonly referred to S.B. 1070 and that allows police to try to determine the immigration status of anybody arrested or detained if they have “reasonable suspicion” the suspect is in the U.S. illegally.However, the law also sparked widespread opposition including businesses threatening to leave the state.Trump and Cruz essentially call for those living illegally in the United States to return to their home country, while Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders want to allow them to stay.Several thousand miles away in New York, demonstrators also took to the streets to protest the Republican presidential hopeful.The protesters gathered Saturday in Manhattan's Columbus Circle, across from Central Park, with a heavy police presence. Demonstrators chanted: ""Donald Trump, go away, racist, sexist, anti-gay.""They marched across south Central Park to Trump Tower, the Fifth Avenue skyscraper where Trump lives. Then they marched back to Columbus Circle for a rally.","Frame as an investigative report, digging deeper into the article's implications.","The protesters blocked a highway leading to Trump’s outdoor rally in Fountain Hills, Arizona, near Scottsdale, before sheriff's deputies removed them and towed their vehicles.

"Dragging on for an excruciating eternity, this election season has demeaned democracy, elevated mediocrity and insulted and embarrassed us all on just about every level imaginable: Intellectually, with regard to the lack of focus on policy and substance; ethically, with a complete disregard for integrity and character; and morally, driven by a disgraceful descent into racist and xenophobic vitriol.Given that our country has consistently climbed down the educational attainment ladder, and that inane and banal reality TV shows draw more eyeballs than books and opera , it should not surprise us that a growing swath of the electorate is more enthused by a coarse, bullying celebrity than by an awkward policy wonk.But what's doubly disappointing -- as we head into the crucial presidential debates -- is that this lack of intellectual depth is enabled not only by the candidates, but also by the topics they gravitate to, which the media frenzy then exacerbates.These are topics that don't matter when it comes to making a difference in the future of our country: the size of a candidate's hands (and therefore other body parts), the now-moot birther issue, the Monica Lewinsky and Marla Maples scandals, the name-calling and finger pointing about who is more racist than whom, who is healthier than whom.","Rewrite the text as a codex or ancient scroll, giving it a historical or mystical aura.","O weary soul, didst thou witness the latest election season, a tale spun in the tapestry of time, a saga etched in the annals of the wretched and the woeful.

"Donald Trump easily won the Washington state primary on Tuesday, but his victory was overshadowed by violence outside a rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where protesters smashed windows and threw rocks at police.With 73% of votes counted in Washington, Trump had won 76.2% of primary voters. John Kasich and Ted Cruz, both of whom have dropped out of the race, had won 9.9.% and 10.1% respectively.Trump’s victory leaves him only needing a few dozen more delegates to reach the magic number of 1,237 required to cement the Republican nomination.Outside Trump’s rally in Albuquerque, protests against the presumptive nominee turned nasty on Tuesday night, with protesters overturning crowd control barriers and throwing rocks at police.There were early posts on social media reporting gunshots and tear gas, but the Albuquerque police department said those were inaccurate. Nonetheless, police horses were deployed to control the large crowd of protesters, and some reports showed pepper spray being used. The door to the convention center where Trump was speaking was also smashed.More than an hour after Trump had finished speaking and left for California, where he will campaign for the next few days in the run-up to the state’s 7 June primary, hundreds of protesters still thronged the streets, waving Mexican flags, lighting fires and chanting.Trump is the only remaining candidate campaigning for the Republican nomination, but Kasich and Cruz were also on the ballot in Washington, having suspended their campaigns after the ballots were printed.Dr Ben Carson was also on the ballot because he reportedly never officially submitted a withdrawal of his candidacy to the state.The state delegation, which was selected on Saturday at the state convention in preparation for the primary, is composed almost entirely of supporters of Cruz, whose supporters overwhelmed the state convention in Pasco.Despite this, the delegates are bound by state party rules to vote for Trump on the first ballot at the national convention, US senate candidate and former chairman of the Washington state Republican party Chris Vance, who was at the convention, told the Guardian.However, with seven upcoming primaries, including New Jersey and California, Trump is expected to easily overtake the delegate mark needed to win the nomination on the first ballot at the convention in Cleveland in July, avoiding a contested convention.In a strange quirk of party politics, the Democrats also held a presidential primary in Washington on Tuesday, but it didn’t matter in the slightest because the Democratic delegation from Washington was already settled by a caucus in March, at which Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton 73% to 27%.Interestingly, in the Democratic primary – which was admittedly meaningless as it has no bearing on the number of delegates as opposed to the caucuses – Clinton won comfortably, 53.63% to 46.37%, implying that perhaps Democratic voters want the primary season to be, finally, over with.","Emphasize the cultural or societal significance of the events or information in the article, discussing broader impacts.","The event highlights the cultural and societal significance of the ongoing Republican presidential primary, shedding light on the potential for violence and the complex dynamics within political campaigns.The primary outcome showcased Trump's continued dominance as the Republican frontrunner, leaving him one step closer to securing the nomination."
"Warren, a hero of progressive Democrats, is the latest party leader to fall in line behind Clinton after she clinched the requisite number of delegates earlier this week over rival Bernie Sanders.Warren told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow tonight, ""I am ready to get in this fight and work my heart out for Hillary Clinton to become the next president of the United States, and to make sure that Donald Trump never gets anyplace close to the White House.""The endorsement comes the same day that President Obama also endorsed Clinton in a video and announced he would campaign with his former 2008 rival next week.But Warren's backing may be more politically important for Clinton than Obama's blessing. The Democratic senator, who remained neutral throughout the contest, championed many of the same economic inequality issues and Wall Street reforms Sanders drew attention to in the primary.She said tonight the 2016 election ""is not about one candidate, it's about all of us coming together coming together to fight to level the [economic] playing field.""In fact, she was urged by many progressive groups early on to challenge Clinton herself, and the ""Ready for Warren"" organization who tried to lay the groundwork for her run ended up endorsing Sanders.Even though she remained on the sidelines, Warren has emerged as a fierce attack dog against presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump, calling him a ""nasty, thin-skinned fraud"" just Thursday. He, in return, has derided her as ""Pocahontas"" — an allusion to a controversy that emerged during her 2012 Senate run after she had claimed Native American ancestry.Tonight Warren said Trump had cheered for the 2007 economic crisis because he knew how to make a profit from it. ""What kind of a person does that?"" she asked, ""an insecure money-grubber who cares about nothing but himself. ... That cannot be the man who leads the United States of America.""Warren has been floated as a possible vice presidential pick for Clinton, a choice that could help allay some concerns among progressives about the former secretary of state's nomination.But there was immediate backlash online to Warren's anticipated nomination. Many supporters took to her Facebook page with profane comments, calling her a ""sell out"" for not endorsing Sanders.","Reframe the article as a motivational speech, inspiring action or change based on the content.","""My dear friends, we stand at a pivotal moment in history. The fate of our nation hangs in the balance, and the choice before us is clear.We have a chance to elect a president who will fight for the working class, address economic inequality, and bring our country together.

"Muhammad will be back on the cover of the next edition of Charlie Hebdo, along with a message of forgiveness from surviving staffers at the French satirical magazine where 12 people were killed last week by a pair of Islamist brothers angered over the publication's penchant for showing images of the prophet.The decimated, but uncowed magazine upped its usual print run of 60,000 copies to 3 million for the magazine, due out Wednesday but released to the French newspaper Liberation. Fierce bidding on eBay had editions commanding as much as $500 following the outpouring of support for Charlie Hebdo, whose four top cartoonists were among the dozen killed. Editor-in-chief Gérard Biard said in a Tuesday radio interview the decision to run a cartoon if Muhammad holding a a “Je Suis Charlie” sign with the caption ""Tout est pardonne,"" or ""All is forgiven,"" and said the message was not that Muhammad was offering forgiveness, as some initially assumed.""It is we who forgive, not Muhammad,” he told France Info.Eight Charlie Hebdo staffers were killed in the attack, including the magazine's editorial director, Stephane Charbonnier, who drew under the name ""Charb.""Biard said tomorrow's issue is meant as both a memorial to fallen co-workers and proof that the magazine's mission of irreverence has not been compromised.""We needed to figure out how to continue laughing and making others laugh,"" he said. ""We wanted to analyze, say something about the events. This drawing made us laugh.He continued: ""We did not want masked men on the cover. We didn't want more of that. That's not us. We didn't want to add to the gravity. It helps to be able to breathe a little.""The cover was created by cartoonist Renald Luzier, who draws under the name ""Luz,"" and created what Biard called a “moving but not sad” work.""Seen by Luz, Mohammed is much more sympathetic than even the Muslims see him. He's a 'nice little guy' as Luz, puts it. Those assassins killed people who draw nice little guys. We wanted to show the ludicrousness of it.”The New York Times reported late Monday that when Luz showed the drawing to staffers, he was greeted with laughter, applause and ironic shouts of ""Allahu akbar!""But one of Egypt's top Islamic authorities has warned Charlie Hebdo against publishing the cartoon.Egypt's Dar al-Ifta, which is in charge of issuing religious edicts, on Tuesday called the planned cover an ""unjustified provocation"" for millions of Muslims who respect and love their prophet.The statement said the cartoon is likely to cause a new wave of hatred in French and Western societies and called on the French government and others to reject ""the racist act"" by Charlie Hebdo.Charlie Hebdo's past caricatures of the Muslim prophet appear to have prompted last week's attacks, part of the worst terrorist rampage in France in decades. A total of 12 people were killed at the newspaper's offices by Said and Cherif Kouachi, French-born brothers who had trained with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.Some witnesses reported that the attackers at the paper's offices shouted ""We have avenged the prophet."" Many Muslims believe all images of Muhammad are blasphemous.French police said Monday that as many as six members of a terrorist cell involved in the attacks may still be at large.France saw its biggest demonstrations in history Sunday as millions turned out to show unity and defend freedom of expression.The Associated Press contributed to this report.","Rewrite the text as a series of public service announcements, highlighting key messages or warnings.","It is important to remember the victims and to stand against all forms of intolerance.""**Public Service Announcement 2:**""The decision to run a cartoon of Muhammad holding a 'Je Suis Charlie' sign is not meant to be interpreted as an endorsement of religious beliefs.

"President Barack Obama is proposing a new strategy in the fight against ISIS, saying the battle against the Islamic State will not be quick. In fact, he says it could take decades.During a rare visit to the Pentagon, Obama laid out his revamped strategy, saying the fight against the Islamic State will require more than just weapons.""No amount of military force will end the terror that is ISIL unless it's matched by a broader effort, political and economic,"" he said.The president said coalition forces will go after the heart of ISIS, but he did not call for more bombing or more troops, announcing instead a shift in focus to counter the terror group's public relations tactics.Obama pointed to a string of ISIS defeats in the region due to airstrikes targeting the group's supply lines. But he said more needs to be done to recruit and train Syrians for the fight on the ground.When it comes to lone wolf terrorists in America inspired by ISIS, the president admitted they're harder to detect, saying U.S. national security must remain vigilant.Obama pointed to increased efforts to counter ISIS's propaganda that's spreading worldwide via social media.""We also have to acknowledge that ISIL has been particularly effective at reaching out to and recruiting vulnerable people around the world, including here in the United States,"" he said.While the fight against ISIS will be long, the president said he's confident the terrorists won't win.But Republicans remain skeptical, saying Obama's plan doesn't go far enough.""A speech isn't a strategy,"" said Cory Fritz, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. ""At no point in his remarks did President Obama indicate he's doing anything to change course and actually build the broad, overarching plan that's needed to take on these savage terrorists and win.""Rep.

"Is It Time To Reconsider Lifetime Appointments To The Supreme Court?The unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia and the looming face-off between the White House and the Senate over his replacement have revived proposals that would limit the tenure of U.S. Supreme Court justices.Legal scholars from both political parties renewed a call Tuesday to reconsider how much time justices spend on the high court. Many of them cited, with disapproval, a bruising and protracted clash building between President Obama and the GOP-controlled Senate over when and how to fill Scalia's vacancy.""The point of life tenure is to keep justices insulated from politics,"" said George Washington University law professor Orin Kerr. ""That didn't quite pan out.""For years now, lawyers have been floating proposals that future high-court justices spend no more than 18 years at a time on the Supreme Court bench. The plan would space out appointments, so presidents would make appointments every two years, supporters said. That would bring regular turnover and fresh thinking to the court — and align with the longer life spans of Americans since the nation's founding, they argue.""It just sounds undemocratic,"" said Gabe Roth, executive director of an advocacy group called Fix the Court, about the lifetime court appointments. ""There's definitely concern about the justices being out of touch. There have been a number of cases with modern technology, whether it be smartphones or bulk data collection or different types of ways of getting TV over the airwaves or over the Internet.""Thomas Merrill, a law professor at Columbia University and a former deputy U.S. solicitor general (1987-1990), said he's been ""a little bit skeptical"" of the idea of term limits for Supreme Court justices. But, Merrill said, his thinking has evolved.""My current cautious endorsement of this is based on the perception that the whole issue of appointments to the Supreme Court has become incredibly contentious, partisan, political, almost to the point where the political system freezes up, as we're witnessing right now with the Scalia death,"" Merrill said. ""It would be a good thing not to have the type of Armageddon it looks like we're about to have.""Term-limit supporters point to a 2015 poll by Reuters/Ipsos, after high-profile rulings on Obama's health care legislation and same-sex marriage, that suggested two-thirds of respondents would support a 10-year limit on tenure on the Supreme Court.But actually changing the system could be remarkably difficult for a political system that's already near paralysis. Some lawyers said the change could be made by lawmakers, but others have concluded it would require amending the Constitution. To do that, the House and Senate would need to vote their support, and then three-quarters of the states would have to approve. Another path would be for two-thirds of the states to call for a Constitutional Convention.""Not likely, but possible,"" Kerr of George Washington University said. ""We'll see how this year goes. It may become unbearable with the president and the Senate duking it out every day.""","Transform the article into a fantasy tale, with elements of magic or myth intertwined with real events.","In the realm of the Supreme Court, where the echoes of justice reverberate through the halls of power, a tale unfolds as ancient as the nation itself.

"Former Florida governor and likely GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush offered a defense of conservative Christian principles and attacked the Obama administration for failing to preserve religious freedom during his commencement address at Liberty University, a Christian school in Lynchburg, Virginia.Bush accused the Obama administration of using ""coercive federal power"" to infringe on the religious rights of Americans.""What should be easy calls, in favor of religious freedom, have instead become an aggressive stance against it. Somebody here is being small-minded and intolerant, and it sure isn’t the nuns, ministers, and laymen and women who ask only to live and practice their faith,"" he said, according to remarks released ahead of the speech. ""Federal authorities are demanding obedience, in complete disregard of religious conscience -- and in a free society, the answer is 'no.'”Last year, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Obama administration could not require closely held corporations to provide insurance coverage of contraception to employees if the employers objected on religious grounds.Bush converted to Catholicism -- his wife's religion -- two decades ago following a tense period in his marriage. Bush has said in the past that he believes the faith of leaders should shape their decision-making.""[S]ome moral standards are universal. They do not bend under the weight of cultural differences or elite opinion. Wherever there is a child waiting to be born, we say choose life, and we say it with love,"" Bush said on Saturday. ""Wherever women and girls in other countries are brutally exploited, or treated as possessions without rights and dignity, we Christians see that arrogance for what it is. Wherever Jews are subjected to the oldest bigotry, we reject that sin against our brothers and sisters, and we defend them.""Liberty University was founded by Jerry Falwell, a former Southern Baptist pastor and religious commentator.

"The federal government must make regular interest payments on the money it has borrowed to finance past deficits – that is, on the national debt held by the public.The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the federal government’s net interest payments on that debt will total $229 billion in the 2015 fiscal year. Working Americans end up having to foot that very large bill to varying degrees based on each individual taxpayer’s adjusted gross income.Click here to see your share of the federal debt.And the CBO expects that this challenge will accelerate over the next decade. Current interest rates are low by historical standards and higher interest rates means higher interest payments. It’s projected that net interest costs will more than triple over the next decade, reaching $808 billion in 2025.These numbers pose a real threat. The CBO has issued warnings about the serious negative consequences that such high and rising debt and interest payments on the debt could have on both the economy and the federal budget.“The large amount of debt might restrict policymakers’ ability to use tax and spending policies to respond to unexpected future challenges, such as economic downturns or financial crises,” the CBO said in a recent report.In the same report, they also cautioned that continued growth in the debt could lead investors to doubt the government’s willingness or ability to pay its obligations, which would require the government to pay much higher interest rates on its borrowing going forward.","Reframe the article as a personal narrative, sharing a personal connection or reflection on the events.","The weight of the national debt hangs like a shadow over the heads of every American citizen.

"One of the big successes in US policing over the past three decades was the push to make law enforcement more data-driven. The big crime-tracking system that came out of this, CompStat, has been widely credited with helping cut crime in the US.But what if this approach has also led police to be too focused on data, turning policing into a numbers game in which cops try to make as many arrests as possible and manipulate the figures to look good?John Eterno, a retired New York City Police Department captain and associate dean and director of graduate studies in criminal justice at Molloy College, explained the problem in a new documentary by FiveThirtyEight:Initially, I think it was easier to bring down crime, because crime was so high. It's kind of like squeezing a lemon — when you squeeze a lemon, the juice is easy to come out initially. But over time, it's more and more difficult.… Commanders are under enormous pressures to make sure that the crime numbers go down. And then the message filters down to the lower rank: If the captain's not doing well, or the inspector's not doing well, we're not doing well.This creates a perverse incentive at some police departments to make crime and policing numbers look favorable to the department at almost any cost. Officers could achieve this by, for example, purposely misinterpreting some crimes as non-serious offenses or not counting them altogether. That way, the mayor and police chief can claim that serious crimes are dropping when, in reality, some serious offenses are just being defined as non-serious or not counted at all.The numbers game also increases demand on cops to look like they're doing more to prevent crime. So officers are sometimes encouraged to stop or arrest as many people as possible so they can appear as if they're staying busy while on duty.And if some cops don't play along, commanders will try to make their lives harder — by, for instance, putting them on the graveyard shift or denying them promotions. Or, in one whistleblower's case, something much worse.The numbers game became a huge focus for the NYPD over the past few decades. And when officer Adrian Schoolcraft tried to expose the abuse, the NYPD retaliated — placing Schoolcraft in a psychiatric institution against his will for six days.Schoolcraft used a tape recorder to capture several examples of officers massaging the numbers at the NYPD. Here are some examples:But Schoolcraft's colleagues found out what he was up to. One day, when he got off work early, an emergency service unit came to his apartment, abducted him, and forcibly admitted him to a psychiatric ward.As they detained him, police discovered the recorder in Schoolcraft's pocket. One high-ranking official, Deputy Chief Michael Marino, couldn't believe it. ""Absolutely amazing,"" he said, according to the recording. ""When I came on the job, a cop would never dream of doing that to another cop for all the money in the world.""Schoolcraft later got the recordings to the Village Voice, a news weekly that broke the story. He is now suing the hospital that held him, as well as New York City and the NYPD.The story shows just how deeply ingrained the numbers game can be in some police departments: Officers are willing to take down their peers and sometimes friends just to avoid getting caught.""I believe they couldn't afford to have someone expose the behavior so bad, so criminal it would threaten their careers,"" Schoolcraft told New York City's ABC 7 in 2010. ""They reacted out of fear.""","Reframe the article to highlight environmental considerations, challenges, or impacts related to the events or information.","The push to make law enforcement more data-driven has had a significant impact on crime reduction in the US. However, it has also led to challenges and environmental considerations that raise concerns about the potential manipulation of data and the impact on officers and the community.One of the primary environmental considerations is the pressure on commanders to make crime numbers look favorable.

"For the first time in months, a national poll shows Donald Trump is not leading the Republican 2016 primary race, and instead has Ben Carson in first place.Carson won the support of 26% of Republican primary voters, compared to 22% who are backing Trump, according to CBS News/New York Times . Though within the poll's margin of error, it marks the first time since the billionaire businessman's dominant rise over the summer where he has been bumped from the top spot nationally.The new numbers also represent a reversal from the last CBS /New York Times poll, taken more than a month ago, which saw Trump leading Carson 27%-23%.Carson and Trump have been running consistently neck-and-neck since the start of September -- with other candidates struggling to keep pace.The switch in the lead comes as Carson has taken a clear lead in the Iowa race, beating Trump in some polls by double-digits. Trump told MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" Tuesday morning ""I don't get it.""CBS/New York Times pollsters found Carson outpacing Trump among women and evangelicals and running even with him among men. Trump performed better with moderate Republicans and voters without college degrees. No other candidate cracked double-digit support in the latest poll. Marco Rubio won 8% support, Jeb Bush and Carly Fiorina tied for fourth place with 7 percent and Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and John Kasich each got 4%.

"""2014 was the planet's warmest year on record. Fourteen of the 15 hottest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century,"" Obama said. ""Yes, this winter was cold in parts of our country, including Washington. Some people in Washington helpfully used a snowball to illustrate that fact. But around the world, in the aggregate, it was the warmest winter ever recorded.""It's of course a huge coincidence that the visit is in the backyard of two Republican presidential hopefuls who have been squishy on the subject of climate change, and a Republican governor who reportedly told state employees they can't even use the words ""climate change.""""Climate change can no longer be denied,"" Obama said. ""It can't be edited out. It can't be omitted from the conversation. And action can no longer be delayed.""   Ahead of the visit, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on a call that Obama would ""use the occasion of Earth Day to highlight his commitment to fighting to protect public health and to fighting the carbon pollution that contributes to climate change."" And the president picked Florida, Earnest said, because it's a place ""where these kinds of issues have traditionally been bipartisan.""Earnest was coy about the fact that Florida also happens to be the home of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio, two likely Republican presidential contenders who haven't been as enthusiastic about climate action. Bush has said he's a ""skeptic"" when it comes to climate change, while Rubio says he doesn't believe human activity is causing the planet to heat up.The president, Earnest said on the call, hopes the visit ""will prompt an elevated political debate about making climate change a priority."" However, he added, the trip is ""not an effort to go to anyone's home state, but to raise the debate.""Earnest maintained that Obama's visit ""isn't about campaigns, this is about making progress on a priority."" But he also noted that ""the Republicans who choose to deny the reality of climate change, they do that to the detriment of the people they're elected to represent.""Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), also no big fan of the concept of climate change, has taken to Twitter to criticize Obama's Everglades visit. Scott argued that the president should do more to get federal funding for Everglades restoration, because, he said, ""Our environment is too important to neglect.""Earnest fired back against Scott on Wednesday. ""It's a little tough to take criticism from someone who has banned the words 'climate change' for the accusation that the president has been insufficiently committed to fighting climate change,"" he said, referring to reports that Florida officials were forbidden from using the terms ""global warming"" and ""climate change"" in official communications. ""That's a tough case to make, but it sounds like that didn't stop him.""The White House also used the occasion to tout the benefits of the National Park Service, which will celebrate its 100th anniversary next year.

"Why Negotiators At Paris Climate Talks Are Tossing The Kyoto ModelNegotiators and heads of state from nearly 200 countries are meeting for the next two weeks near Paris to craft a new treaty to slow global warming.It's the 21st ""Conference of the Parties"" held by the United Nations to tackle climate change. One treaty emerged, in 1997, after the conference in Kyoto, Japan. That's no longer in effect, and, in fact, the Kyoto Protocol, as it's known, didn't slow down the gradual warming of the planet.Now governments are ever more desperate to do something to slow warming — so much so that they've thrown out the model set in Kyoto and opted for a new approach for Paris.Valli Moosa, a former climate negotiator from South Africa, says the main reason Kyoto failed to slow warming lies largely with who wasn't included in the treaty. ""You actually cannot have a meaningful agreement without China and the United States being part of it,"" he says.The U.S. Senate refused to ratify the Kyoto treaty, so the world's biggest greenhouse-gas emitter didn't have skin in the game. And developing countries, including China and India, were not required to reduce emissions. Now those countries are becoming the biggest sources of greenhouse gases as their economies thrive. China, in fact, is now the world's biggest emitter, and India isn't far behind. Moreover, the Kyoto treaty had U.N. bureaucrats and negotiators setting goals for the participating countries to lower their greenhouse gases. Many countries didn't make their targets; others dropped out. Economies were at stake, and few countries were comfortable marching to a U.N. beat.So what negotiators are bringing to the table at the Paris talks is an arrangement whereby each country is offering to reduce its own emissions by whatever amount it can manage. And everybody participates, not just developed countries.Most nations arrive with a reduction target already in hand. What will be difficult is deciding who will pay how much to developing countries to build economies that won't keep producing high emissions.French negotiator Laurence Tubiana points out that the key to success is convincing governments that those economies can be ""low-carbon,"" and that this won't be a bar to developing wealth. ""How much I'm sacrificing for the sake of emissions reductions, that's no more,"" she says of the message that negotiators are pushing. ""And now ... the Chinese, even the Indians are really coming in. It's about low-carbon economy.""Previous attempts to replace the Kyoto treaty have failed. This new approach is voluntary, and most of the world has agreed theoretically to participate, which negotiators hope will sweeten things enough to get a deal. Still to be determined, however, is who will pay for this massive revolution in the world's energy economy, and what strings will be attached to their largesse.",Rewrite the article as a gripping short story with a moral at the end.,"Negotiators and heads of state from nearly 200 countries gathered in the grand halls of the city, their faces etched with the burden of saving the planet.

"The Senate worked late into the night Friday and early Saturday, but still failed to agree on extending government surveillance programs under the USA Patriot Act before the Memorial Day holiday.Lawmakers blocked votes on both a House-passed bill and a short-term extension of the Patriot Act provisions that allow government surveillance programs.Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says lawmakers will try again on May 31, the day before the provisions expire.The Senate first took up the House bill, which would end the National Security Agency's bulk collection of domestic phone records. That bill, passed overwhelmingly by the House and supported by the Obama administration, required a 60-vote majority to proceed. It fell three votes short.The Senate then failed to advance a two-month extension of the expiring Patriot Act provision that would extend the NSA phone records program. That vote was seven short of the required 69 votes, reports NPR Washington desk senior editor Shirley Henry.Sen. Majority Leader McConnell tried to secure unanimous consent agreements on a number of measures aimed at preventing the program from lapsing on June 1, when the Patriot Act provision expires, Henry reports.McConnell first proposed a measure to extend the act to June 8. But Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican presidential contender, objected, saying he wants two amendments debated and voted on.""Our forefathers would be aghast,"" Paul said.Henry reports that McConnell then tried for an extension to June 5, but there was an objection. His proposal for June 3 met another objection; then Paul objected to a June 2 extension, Henry says.Unable to get agreement on any extension, McConnell said the Senate will come back at 4 p.m. on May 31 to try again, beginning with a vote on the House bill. That gives lawmakers only a few hours to prevent the Patriot Act provisions from expiring.The majority leader stressed that it's a dangerous time to allow the law to expire, given the threats overseas and attempted attacks here, and urged the Senate to act ""responsibly"" to protect the country, Henry reports.The Justice Department has said the NSA would begin winding down collection of domestic phone records this week if the Senate failed to act, according to the Associated Press.","Incorporate historical context into the article, comparing and contrasting the events or information with similar historical events or trends.","The event parallels the controversial passage of the Patriot Act in 2001 and the subsequent debates over its renewal.The Patriot Act, enacted in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, authorized the government to collect and store vast amounts of data on Americans"
"Shouts of “shame, shame, shame” erupted in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday as Republican lawmakers narrowly defeated legislation to protect the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees of government contractors.The measure, an amendment to a veterans and military construction spending bill introduced by New York Democrat Sean Maloney, initially had enough “yes” votes to pass, according to the count in the House chamber.But House Republican leaders extended the time allowed for the vote as they urged enough party members to change their positions to defeat it by a vote of 213 to 212.All 183 Democrats who voted backed the amendment, joined by 29 Republicans. All 213 “no’s” were from Republicans. Eight House members – three Republicans and five Democrats – did not vote.LGBT rights have been a hot-button issue during the 2016 election season. National politics have featured debate over whether making cakes for same-sex couples violates bakers’ religious freedom or whether the government should decide which public bathrooms are used by transgender people.Democrats chanted “shame, shame, shame” at Republicans, drawing attention to the vote. Steny Hoyer, the number two House Democrat, denounced it in a fiery speech. “We had 217 people for non-discrimination right up until the last moment,” he said.Thursday’s emotional vote came hours after the House late on Wednesday passed a $602 billion defense authorization bill that included “religious freedom” language that critics said would allow contractors to discriminate against LGBT individuals.The House Rules committee had angered Democrats by voting along party lines late on Tuesday not to allow a vote on an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would have eliminated that language.Republicans who backed the provision said it was necessary to protect the religious rights of military contractors and not intended to be discriminatory.","Rewrite the text as a series of public service announcements, highlighting key messages or warnings.","****Public Service Announcement 1:**""The fight for LGBT rights continues in the U.S. House of Representatives.

"Under new overtime rules, employees will be injured as well.The Labor Department’s change to the overtime rule is a harsh blow to millions of small businesses and their employees. According to NFIB research, approximately 44% of small businesses would be affected. The department claims that 4.2 million workers could potentially benefit from the change. That’s not consistent with the department’s own analysis.In fact, buried within the regulation, the department projects that many workers won’t receive any additional pay and that others will lose pay. According to Labor, 60% of the newly eligible employees don’t work overtime right now. The department also estimates that the average hourly pay rate will decline in 2017. The talking points say this is a raise for workers, but the economic analysis says something completely different.Most small businesses have razor-thin margins, and they cannot simply raise prices to cover higher costs without losing customers. Moreover, the median personal income for small business owners is roughly $68,000 annually, according to NFIB research. Big corporations can trim shareholder dividends, cut CEO pay or move production facilities out of the country. Those aren’t options for most small firms.Employees will be injured as well. Managers who haven’t punched a clock in years will have to go back to filling out a time sheet. They will even have to take into account work from home such as checking email or fielding a phone call. Essentially, they’ll be demoted from their management positions to hourly jobs.The overtime rule is another government mandate that makes it costlier and more difficult to run a business and create jobs. NFIB surveys its members every month to identify their top concerns.

"Say what you will about Donald Trump, but the man is winner. Trump didn’t just wallop his opponents Tuesday — he crushed them. Up 41 percent in Delaware, 40 percent in Rhode Island, 37 percent in Pennsylvania, 33 percent in Maryland, 30 percent in Connecticut, he’s estimated to have won 110 delegates, versus five for Kasich and three for Cruz.If the race for the GOP nomination were a Little League game, the mercy rule would be imposed.Here’s where we stand today. Ted Cruz is mathematically eliminated from winning the Republican nomination before the convention in Cleveland. John Kasich has now won a single state — Ohio — where he is governor. If ever there were a series of states that would at least theoretically be fertile territory for him, it would be the Northeast, home of the last vestiges of Republican moderates. Yet, he didn’t crack 30 percent anywhere. Republicans can talk all they want about Never Trump and trying to stop him at the RNC in Cleveland. They can talk about changing the rules and holding out hope that a white knight candidate will emerge. It isn’t going to happen. Either Trump is the nominee or he’ll burn the whole thing to the ground. If you’re a gambler, go all in on the former.It is worth stepping back, however, and noting that Trump’s hammerlock over the party — and his ascendancy within the GOP — is astounding. He’s a political amateur who never held elected office; he’s a xenophobe, a bully, and a misogynist and he has run directly against the leadership of the party he hopes to lead. Yet, today he stands on the cusp of winning the nomination of the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Nixon, and Reagan. I know we’ve all become inured to Trump’s insults, his know-nothingness, and his crudeness, but it can’t be said enough — truly we are living in a political moment unlike anything that any of us has seen before.Here’s what might be even more amazing: Trump’s position as the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party is not the most remarkable political event this year. Rather, it’s that the Democratic Party is poised to nominate the first woman to be a major party candidate for president. Somehow this constantly seems to be forgotten; and whether you like Hillary Clinton or despise her, that America is poised to nominate a woman for president is a big deal.Tuesday night, Clinton racked up four more primary wins, including the delegate-rich states of Maryland and Pennsylvania. Only in Rhode Island did Bernie Sanders thwart her. Early on in the evening, before all the races had been called, he gave a “victory” speech in West Virginia that not only left unmentioned the evening’s results, but plowed forward with confidence about the road ahead. It’s a fitting metaphor for the Sanders campaign, which increasingly seems to operate in a realm completely divorced from reality. Sanders cannot and will not win the Democratic nomination. Period.Indeed, in her victory speech, Clinton — as she has increasingly done — simply ignored Sanders. Instead she aimed her daggers at her real target, Donald Trump. The Democratic race will continue, but for all intents and purposes, it is over. Clinton can now begin her pivot to the general election, and Sanders can play out the string.What we now with some certainty is that we’re only a few months away from an historic, unprecedented presidential campaign — and no matter which candidate wins on Election Day, history will be made.",Compose the article as a series of diary entries from the perspective of someone involved in the events.,"The world is spinning.

"U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday’s unity march against terrorism.Kerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.The visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.The French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday’s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.Among roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.Kerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi’s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.In a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as “quibbling a little bit.” He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.“But that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,” he said.“And I don’t think the people of France have any doubts about America’s understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.”","Frame as an investigative report, digging deeper into the article's implications.","Kerry's upcoming visit to Paris and his plans to address criticism for the lack of top American officials at Sunday's unity march against terrorism.The visit is seen as an attempt to mend relations between the U.S. and France, which have been strained in recent months.

He insists outside agitators are at fault, and even laid some of the blame on Sanders supporters – and indeed many of the Vermont senator's supporters did show up.""It was totally organized, troublemakers, troublemakers,"" Trump said.

"“Our fight for LGBT equality is not nearly over,” Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) stated emphatically in an interview with me last week on SiriusXM Progress. “And I’m hopeful, very hopeful, that the Supreme Court will say it’s unconstitutional to ban gay marriage. But that’s really just the beginning of fighting for our rights. We have to actually make sure all LGBT couples can have full parenting rights, have full social security and other federal benefit rights. We want to make sure companies can’t discriminate against members of the community because of who they love and who they are. And it’s really important [to take on] discrimination wherever it exists.”Toward that end, Gillibrand last week reintroduced the Every Child Deserve a Family Act, which she originally introduced in 2013 and which would bar adoption and foster care agencies that receive federal dollars from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. Though Gillibrand says she's seeking bipartisan support in the Senate and will continue speaking with Republicans, so far co-sponsors include a handful of fellow Democrats, such as openly lesbian Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is running for the Democratic nomination for the presidency.“Only seven states ban discrimination based on sexual orientation in adoption, and only five explicitly ban discrimination in foster care,” Gillibrand said in the interview. “So we have a long way to go. We only have a few states protecting LGBT parents. The reality is, there are two million LGBT individuals and families that are willing and able to take on these parenting obligations, to adopt these children or foster these children who desperately need it. Unfortunately, there are 400,000 children in the U.S. foster care system today and more than 20,000 of them are going to age-out before finding a permanent home. So we should be caring for these kids. We should give them the loving families they deserve.”The bill, if it becomes law, would only affect those agencies that take federal money, and they are free to opt-out from receiving funds.""If you’re getting the benefit of federal funds, you can’t discriminate,” Gillibrand said. “It’s unconstitutional, and you should not be able to use our taxpayer dollars to discriminate against individuals based on their sexual orientation and who they love. So I think it’s important we fight against it, particularly when our taxpayer dollars are being used.”“This legislation would prohibit adoption agencies and foster care agencies, including religious adoption agencies and foster care agencies, from providing services in many cases,” Lori Windham, Senior Counsel with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty told the Catholic news agency, EWTN News. Peter Sprigg, senior fellow for policy studies at the Family Research Council, is quoted in the same article saying there are “unique problems” with allowing gays and lesbians to adopt children. Claiming there is “overwhelming” evidence while not citing any studies, Sprigg said, “I think it’s legitimate to disfavor them or to exclude them altogether.”","Propose as a community project plan, inspired by solutions mentioned or implied in the text.","**Key points:*** The fight for LGBT equality is not over, and there is a long way to go to ensure full rights and protections.* The bill would bar adoption and foster care agencies that receive federal dollars from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation.* There are two million LGBT"

"BREAKING: Black-clad gunmen stormed the Paris offices of a satirical newspaper known for lampooning Islamic radicals early Wednesday, killing 12 and injuring as many as 15 before escaping, French officials said.As many as three Kalashnikov-toting shooters were being sought after the attack at Charlie Hebdo, the newspaper known for challenging Muslim terrorists with a 2011 caricature of Prophet Mohammed on its cover and which recently tweeted a cartoon of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Two policemen and several journalists - including the cartoonist behind the newspaper's provocative images, were among the dead.“We’ve avenged the honor of the prophet!” the killers shouted, according to witnesses who spoke to Sky News. The gunmen spoke French without any accent, according to Le MondeThe gunmen fled in a stolen car, and may have quickly ditched it and disappeared into the French capital's subway system, according to reports. A pedestrian has been injured by the terrorist’s vehicle, and there has been a second shootout, according to Le Figaro.French President Francois Hollande branded the attack an act of terrorism and claimed that several other potential terror attacks had been thwarted ""in recent weeks."" Hollande added that the newspaper had been threatened in the past and was already under police protection and surveillance.“This is a terrorist attack, there is no doubt about it,” Hollande told reporters.Elsewhere in France, newspaper offices, shopping centers, museums and stations were placed under police protection.Officials said the men walked into the ground floor of the newspaper's offices and began shooting before making their way up to the first floor. As they fled the scene, they shot at arriving policemen.“It was a real butchery,” Rocco Contento, a spokesman for the Unité police union, told The Guardian.Benoit Bringer, a journalist from the agency Premieres Lignes Tele, whose offices are next door, told the Telegraph he took refuge on the building's roof.""Three policemen arrived by push bike, but they left naturally as the attackers were armed,"" he said.The newspaper's offices are in the trendy 11th arrondissement of Paris, which includes posh restaurants and retail shops.Charlie Hebdo's offices were firebombed in 2011 after a spoof issue featuring a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad on its cover. Nearly a year later, the magazine published crude Muhammad caricatures, drawing denunciations around the Muslim world. One of the dead in Wednesday's attack was satirical cartoonist Stephane Charbonnier, the newspaper's editorial director and the artist behind the caricatures that offended jihadists. He was the subject of a fatwah, and there is a Facebook page called ""Execute Stephane Charbonnier.""British Prime Minister David Cameron condemned the attack and vowed solidarity with France.""The murders in Paris are sickening,"" Cameron said.

"The U.S. economy created the fewest number of jobs in more than five years in May, hurt by a strike by Verizon workers and a fall in goods producing employment, pointing to labor market weakness that could make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 38,000 jobs last month, the smallest gain since September 2010, the Labor Department said on Friday. Employers hired 59,000 fewer workers in March and April. The government said the month-long Verizon strike had depressed employment growth by 34,000 jobs.The goods producing sector, which includes mining and manufacturing, shed 36,000 jobs, the most since February 2010. Even without the Verizon strike, payrolls would have increased by a mere 72,000.The Verizon workers, who were considered unemployed because they did not receive a salary during the payrolls survey week, returned to their jobs on Wednesday. They are expected to boost June employment.The jobless rate fell three-tenths of a percentage point to 4.7 percent in May, the lowest since November 2007. The decrease in the unemployment rate was in part due to people dropping out of the labor force.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising 164,000 in May and the unemployment rate falling to 4.9 percent.Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said monthly gains of roughly 100,000 jobs are needed to keep up with growth in the work-age population. The U.S. central bank has signaled its intention to raise rates soon if job gains continued and economic data remained consistent with a pickup in growth in the second quarter.Yellen said last week that a rate increase would probably be appropriate in the ""coming months,"" if those conditions were met. Data on consumer spending, industrial production, goods exports and housing have suggested the economy is gathering speed after growth slowed to a 0.8 percent annualized rate in the first quarter.The Fed hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.There is still no sign of meaningful wage growth. Average hourly earnings rose five cents, or 0.2 percent, last month. That kept the year-on-year rise at 2.5 percent.Economists say wage growth of between 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent is needed to lift inflation to the Fed's 2.0 percent target. There are, however, signs that inflation is creeping higher as the dampening effects of the dollar's past rally and the oil price plunge dissipate.There was little change in other measures of labor market slack. A broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment held steady at 9.7 percent in May.The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell 0.2 percentage point to 62.6 percent.The gains in May were broadly weak, with the private sector adding only 25,000 jobs, the smallest since February 2010. Mining employment maintained its downward trend, shedding 10,000 positions. Mining payrolls have dropped by 207,000 since peaking in September 2014, with three-quarters of the losses in support activities.Manufacturing employment fell by 10,000 jobs. The Verizon labor dispute reduced information sector jobs by 34,000.Retail payrolls rose 11,400 after shedding jobs in April for the first time since December 2014.

"As the Democratic presidential contest reaches the third state, what began as a coronation is now an exciting dead heat. Yet by one measure, Bernie Sanders is ­already a clear winner.Regardless of whether the senator from Vermont captures the actual nomination, he has won the future of the Democratic Party.Sanders is demolishing the last remnants of the old order, as represented by Hillary Clinton and her split-the-difference triangulation. It is Sanders, not she, who is the true heir of the radical politics of Barack Obama.Calling a paradigm shift is like forecasting a recession — predict it often enough and you’ll eventually be right. Yet the developments unfolding before our eyes suggest the Democratic Party is undergoing a massive change. And a 74-year-old socialist is the architect.A major piece of evidence is the enormous youth vote he attracts. In Iowa and New Hampshire, he beat Clinton by about 70 points — 84 percent to 15 percent — among voters under age 30. And despite the nasty demands by Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem that women must support Clinton, Sanders got 82 percent of the young female vote.By contrast, Obama in the 2008 primaries typically beat Clinton among young people by about 20 points. With studies showing that most people stay in their first political party for many years, the young, ultra-liberal voters who turned out for Obama, and who are being joined by the Sanders wave, could dominate the party for a generation.Click to read Goodwin’s full column in the New York Post.Michael Goodwin is a Fox News contributor and New York Post columnist.",Convert into a dialogue between two people with opposing views on the subject.,"**Person 1:**""Bernie Sanders is a clear winner.

"Speaking from Hiroshima, the site of the first war-time atomic weapon detonation, President Obama on Friday called for the pursuit of ""a world without nuclear weapons.""Only a few days prior, his Department of Defense published new data revealing that the government Obama oversees -- a government which manages the second-largest nuclear stockpile in the world -- had dismantled fewer of its nuclear devices than in any year since at least 1980.Every year, the Department of Defense declassifies data on the size of the country's nuclear stockpile and the number of warheads dismantled. Its most recent data, released this week, shows that the U.S. stockpile numbered 4,571 at the end of 2015, about 15 percent of its size at its peak during the Cold War in 1967. The number of weapons dismantled was 109, the lowest figure since at least 1980.In 1945, the size of the stockpile matched the number of weapons deployed -- two. The biggest reductions came in the early 1990s during the administration of George H.W. Bush and, a decade later, during his son's. At the end of 2008, the stockpile numbered 5,273; over the course of Obama's two terms, it has dropped to 4,571.It is, of course, easier to reduce the size of a stockpile when it is much larger. As a fraction of the total weapon count, Obama has sliced the total by a bit more than one-tenth -- 13 percent. But the Federation of American Scientists is still critical of Obama's progress in this regard. That 13 percent is ""the smallest reduction of the stockpile achieved by any previous post-Cold War administration;"" the 109 dismantlings last year continues ""a trendline of fewer and fewer warheads dismantled"" under Obama. The FAS notes that there are reasons outside of the administration's control for the lower number last year -- but also that political pressure discourages a push for reduction.Why does the size of our stockpile matter? As data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows, the United States still controls about half of the weapons controlled by recognized nuclear states.",Format as a series of postcards from someone living through the article's events.,"From the heart of Hiroshima, I'm writing to you with a postcard from a city forever scarred by the tragedy of war.

"President Barack Obama said the U.S. and its allies must strip away any legitimacy that Islamic State and al-Qaeda claim by portraying themselves as religious movements.Obama, who has come under criticism from Republicans who say he avoids acknowledging the Muslim roots of extremist groups, said terrorists use religion as a recruiting tool by portraying the U.S. and European nations as being at war with Islam.“We must never accept the premise they put forward, because it is a lie,” Obama said Wednesday in Washington on the second day of a White House summit on combating extremism. “They are not religious leaders. They’re terrorists. And we are not at war with Islam. We are at war with people who have perverted Islam.”Deadly attacks in Paris, Sydney and Copenhagen by individuals of Muslim background and possibly inspired by the brutal tactics of Islamic State, along with the group’s spread in Syria, Iraq and now Libya, have raised alarms in Europe and the U.S. about the danger of lone-wolf terrorists, driven by extremist ideology and difficult to detect before they act.At the summit, the Obama administration is convening representatives of Muslim organizations, law enforcement officials and local political leaders to swap ideas about how to stem root causes of extremism. It also has invited leaders from overseas to take part.Obama said civic leaders must recognize that Islamic State and al-Qaeda “deliberately target their propaganda in the hopes of reaching and brainwashing young Muslims” through videos, social media and other online outlets. He said the one way to counter that is to alleviate the alienation and poverty that are the extremists’ best recruiting tool.In the U.S., he said, local and federal authorities must make sure that Muslims aren’t isolated and that they are welcomed and integrated into society.“Muslim Americans feel they have been unfairly targeted,” he said. “We have to be sure that abuses stop, are not repeated, that we do not stigmatize entire communities.”Former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore, who is chairman of a political action committee aimed at electing Republicans, called the conference a “farce” in a statement and said the administration should be targeting terrorists rather than offering “pie-in-the-sky social welfare programs” to Muslims here and overseas.The administration’s strategy is also aimed at drawing in the domestic Muslim leaders who Obama is leaning on to identify and isolate potentially violent extremists. Yet some groups say they remain suspicious about the administration’s motivation.The Muslim Advocates, an Oakland Calif.-based group that that was invited to a White House meeting earlier this month, expressed concern that Obama’s requests for “partnerships” with Muslim community and religious leaders is code for requiring leaders to play a law enforcement role.They also blasted Obama for focusing too narrowly on Muslims, a decision that the group says reinforces a negative stereotype that Islam and terror are linked.“This whole day is focused on American Muslims, frankly,” Farhana Khera, the group’s executive director, said in a telephone interview. “It strikes at the core of what we are as Americans.”Obama is speaking on the topic again tomorrow at the State Department during a session that includes representatives from overseas, including France, Belgium, Mexico and Japan.",Describe the events as if they were part of a historical epic tale.,"The halls of the White House echoed with the sound of history on Wednesday as President Barack Obama unveiled a plan to combat the insidious force of extremism.

"Kim Davis — the Rowan County, Kentucky Clerk who earlier today brazenly defied the Supreme Court’s order to issue marriage licenses citing “God’s authority” — has been ordered to stand before U.S. District Judge David Bunning on Thursday and explain why she shouldn’t be jailed and fined for her actions.In a statement released after she refused, for the fourth time, to issue David Moore and David Ermold a marriage license, Davis said that “[t]o issue a marriage license which conflicts with God’s definition of marriage, with my name affixed to the certificate, would violate my conscience. It is not a light issue for me. It is a Heaven or Hell decision.”“I was elected by the people to serve as the County Clerk,” she continued, and “I intend to continue to serve the people of Rowan County, but I cannot violate my conscience.” That she is an elected official has become a point of contention, because as such she can’t be fired for refusing to abide by the Supreme Court’s ruling. Removing her from office would entail impeachment proceedings, which will either have to wait until the next legislative session or require the calling of a special session, which could be prohibitively expensive.In the meantime, no one in Rowan County will be issued a marriage licenses. Lawyers representing the four couples who were denied licenses told the Associated Press that “[s]ince Defendant Davis continues to collect compensation from the Commonwealth for duties she fails to perform,” they want Judge Bunning to “impose financial penalties sufficiently serious and increasingly onerous” — but that they are not seeking for her to be jailed for contempt.

""Once you get into it, this is a Democratic election for our nominee and it gets really close, exciting. And it really depends upon on who can make the best case that you can be the nominee to beat whoever the Republicans put up and try to get your folks who support you to come out.""She added, ""I find it pretty exciting.

Clinton's interview with Fallon was her second appearance on ""The Tonight Show"" as a presidential candidate and came on the same night as the Fox Business Network hosted a Republican debate.

"NOT ON THE SHORT LISTFormer Vice President Dick Cheney may hate Donald Trump, but he’s fine with him leading the country.Cheney reportedly told CNN on Friday he intends to support the GOP nominee in 2016, just as he has every prior cycle.Shortly after the first presidential debate, Cheney told Fox News’ Bret Baier that the real estate mogul’s assertions regarding the September 11 attacks—including that George W. Bush willingly let them happen—were “way off base.”“He clearly doesn’t understand or has not spent any time learning about the facts of that period,” Cheney said.It’s a little curious that Cheney has decided to board the Trump Train. It’s also a break from the rest of Bush World, as representatives for George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush say neither former president will back the mogul’s presidential bid.In 2011, Trump made a YouTube video for his “From The Desk of Donald Trump” series, (a series I cannot recommend highly enough), in which the presumptive nominee trashed the former VP and his then-newly released memoir.“He’s very, very angry and nasty,” the mogul said. “I didn’t like Cheney when he was a vice president. I don’t like him now. And I don’t like people that rat out everybody like he’s doing in the book. I’m sure it’ll be a best-seller, but isn’t it a shame?

And they tried to impeach him, which was nonsense. And, yet, Bush got us into this horrible war with lies, by lying, by saying they had weapons of mass destruction, by saying all sorts of things that turned out not to be true.”“Religious freedom’s been a very important part of our history and where we came from,” he added—but if Cheney has anything to do with it, then Trump’s America is where we’re going.",Convert into a dialogue between two people with opposing views on the subject.,"**Person 1:**""It's a little curious that former Vice President Dick Cheney has decided to support Donald Trump.

"(CNN) Donald Trump is ratcheting up his rhetoric about American Muslims, saying there's precedent for monitoring some mosques amid the recent terror wave.At a Birmingham, Alabama, rally on Saturday -- which included a physical altercation between a black protester and several white Trump backers -- the 2016 Republican front-runner suggested law enforcement keep an eye on certain Islamic houses of worship which, in his view, could pose terrorist threats.""I want surveillance of certain mosques if that's OK,"" Trump told the often-raucous and approving crowd. ""We've had it before.""The remarks echo a call Trump made earlier in the week, when he said on MSNBC he'd ""strongly consider"" shutting down mosques in the U.S.The billionaire businessman also linked current terrorist concerns, after the Paris carnage and other attacks, with 9/11.""I watched the World Trade Center go down,"" Trump asserted, adding he watched in New Jersey, ""as thousands of people were cheering as the building was coming down.""Trump then denounced calls to resettle Syrian refuges on U.S. soil, which his Republican rivals for the nomination also oppose.""I want surveillance. I will absolutely take (a) database on the people coming in from Syria. ""If we can't stop it -- but we are going to if I win -- they're going back.""Several attendees at the rally punched and kicked a protester who tried to disrupt Trump's speech.At least a half-dozen attendees shoved and tackled the protester, a black man, to the ground as he refused to leave the event. At least one man punched the protester and a woman kicked him while he was on the ground.All of the attendees who were involved in the physical altercation with the protester were white.The protester appeared to be shouting ""black lives matter"" and later removed his sweatshirt to reveal a shirt with those words.At least one attendee shouted ""all lives matter"" as the protester was eventually led out by police officers on the scene.Birmingham Police Lt. Sean Edwards told CNN that three people were asked to leave the event following the scuffle. No arrests were made, and the protester did not require medical attention.Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks told CNN that ""the campaign does not condone this behavior.""Trump has fended off criticism recently that he was accused of backing a U.S. database on all Muslims in the country. Trump has denied making that remark but hasn't dismissed the idea out-of-hand.The database controversy began Thursday when Trump told Yahoo News that he would create new anti-terrorism measures if he's elected.""We're going to have to do things that we never did before. And some people are going to be upset about it, but I think that now everybody is feeling that security is going to rule,"" he told Yahoo News. ""And certain things will be done that we never thought would happen in this country in terms of information and learning about the enemy. And so we're going to have to do certain things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago.""The Yahoo reporter asked about the possibility of a database for Muslims or ""a form of special identification that noted their religion."" Trump did not say no to either idea. Then, after an Iowa campaign event later that day, an NBC reporter asked Trump if he favored a database to track Muslims in the country. Trump responded in a way some took as backing that idea.At Saturday's rally in Alabama, Trump said he decided not to answer once he heard the reporter identified as being with NBC News.","Convert the article into a mystery or detective story, building suspense around the events described.","Donald Trump, the 2016 Republican front-runner, was spewing his rhetoric about American Muslims, and the crowd was eating it up.""We need surveillance of certain mosques if that's OK,"" Trump declared, his voice resonating through the hall.

"WASHINGTON -- Senate leaders announced Tuesday that they've resolved a weeks-long standoff over a sex trafficking bill containing controversial anti-abortion language, clearing the way, at last, for U.S. attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch to get her confirmation vote.Lynch has been waiting for more than five months for a confirmation vote. Most recently, Republican leaders tied the vote to passage of the trafficking bill. That bill has nothing to do with Lynch, but as long as it wasn't moving, neither was Lynch's confirmation.Aides to Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas) have been working for weeks to break the impasse. As introduced, the bill would have collected fees from sex traffickers and put them into a new victims fund that would be subject to the Hyde Amendment, the federal provision that bars the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape and incest. Democrats objected to the abortion language in general, but more so because the bill expanded the Hyde Amendment to include private funds.Under the deal announced Tuesday, the bill will create two funding streams. The first one flows from fines collected from sex traffickers, and would be used for survivor services excluding health care. This stream would not include Hyde Amendment restrictions. The second one would come from community health center funds that are already subject to the abortion limits.The deal lets both parties walk away with a solid talking point: Democrats can celebrate that they prevented an expansion of Hyde, while Republicans can say they didn't cave on restricting abortion funds.""I’m pleased that we were able to reach a deal that gets this done in a way that does not expand restrictions on women’s health to non-taxpayer dollars or to new programs, and provides survivors with real dedicated funds for the support and services they need,"" Murray said on the Senate floor.A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he expects the Senate to pass the sex trafficking bill on Wednesday. From there, the Senate will move to Lynch's confirmation vote.McConnell said the attorney general nominee should get a vote ""in the next day or so.""Last week, President Barack Obama fumed that Republicans have made Lynch wait for so long, saying the delay is just ""embarrassing.""CORRECTION: This story previously misstated the nature of the survivor services that would benefit from the funding collected from sex trafficking fines under the legislation. Those services would not include health care.","Rewrite the article focusing on its impact at a local level, even if the original story has national or international significance.","The sex trafficking bill that stalled the confirmation of U.S. attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch has also impacted the local community of Washington state.The bill, which has been tied to the confirmation process for months, would have collected fees from sex traffickers and put them into a new victims fund that would be subject to the Hyde Amendment.

"Boston magazine has a long take on William Weld, former Massachusetts governor, currently Libertarian vice presidential candidate.The main takeaway, after some of the usual slightly sneery scene-setting about weirdo libertarians (reported from July's FreedomFest in Las Vegas) and the lovely color detail of the patrician Weld being amazed he's staying in a New York hotel whose price is three digits beginning with ""one""?That while Weld totally thinks of himself as libertarian and has for a long time, he's also a guy who just likes to do strange and challenging things as a lark, like writing novels, and hates being bored and likes being in the political mix.An unnamed former adviser says ""There's nothing more he would like than to be flying around the country on somebody else's dime, flying first class, and talking to political reporters all day."" Another unnamed former staffer says of Weld ""He is old money, white, and fucking brilliant...Everybody tries to distance himself from those traits when running for office, and he always embraced them and made them his own.""Reason has written quite a bit on some conflicts between Weld and libertarianism as most define it, despite Weld's long-time affection for that self-identification, and this profile is decent on explaining that aspect of the Weld/Libertarian story.The profile by Simon van Zuylen-Wood sums up that conflict:Weld's strategy isn't to try to defend libertarian ideas. Instead he articulates the ones he thinks disaffected centrists want to hear. When Johnson suggests abolishing the Internal Revenue Service, Weld raises an eyebrow and clarifies that he wouldn't go that far. When asked about gun control, Weld suggests the formation—cue a million Libertarians choking on their dinner—of a massive new FBI task force.... .... I ask him, at random, about climate change. He advocates pragmatic, mainstream, and essentially unlibertarian ideas about the urgent need for governing bodies to prevent the rise of global temperatures by 2 degrees Celsius.

"Why Negotiators At Paris Climate Talks Are Tossing The Kyoto ModelNegotiators and heads of state from nearly 200 countries are meeting for the next two weeks near Paris to craft a new treaty to slow global warming.It's the 21st ""Conference of the Parties"" held by the United Nations to tackle climate change. One treaty emerged, in 1997, after the conference in Kyoto, Japan. That's no longer in effect, and, in fact, the Kyoto Protocol, as it's known, didn't slow down the gradual warming of the planet.Now governments are ever more desperate to do something to slow warming — so much so that they've thrown out the model set in Kyoto and opted for a new approach for Paris.Valli Moosa, a former climate negotiator from South Africa, says the main reason Kyoto failed to slow warming lies largely with who wasn't included in the treaty. ""You actually cannot have a meaningful agreement without China and the United States being part of it,"" he says.The U.S. Senate refused to ratify the Kyoto treaty, so the world's biggest greenhouse-gas emitter didn't have skin in the game. And developing countries, including China and India, were not required to reduce emissions. Now those countries are becoming the biggest sources of greenhouse gases as their economies thrive. China, in fact, is now the world's biggest emitter, and India isn't far behind. Moreover, the Kyoto treaty had U.N. bureaucrats and negotiators setting goals for the participating countries to lower their greenhouse gases. Many countries didn't make their targets; others dropped out. Economies were at stake, and few countries were comfortable marching to a U.N. beat.So what negotiators are bringing to the table at the Paris talks is an arrangement whereby each country is offering to reduce its own emissions by whatever amount it can manage. And everybody participates, not just developed countries.Most nations arrive with a reduction target already in hand. What will be difficult is deciding who will pay how much to developing countries to build economies that won't keep producing high emissions.French negotiator Laurence Tubiana points out that the key to success is convincing governments that those economies can be ""low-carbon,"" and that this won't be a bar to developing wealth. ""How much I'm sacrificing for the sake of emissions reductions, that's no more,"" she says of the message that negotiators are pushing. ""And now ... the Chinese, even the Indians are really coming in. It's about low-carbon economy.""Previous attempts to replace the Kyoto treaty have failed. This new approach is voluntary, and most of the world has agreed theoretically to participate, which negotiators hope will sweeten things enough to get a deal. Still to be determined, however, is who will pay for this massive revolution in the world's energy economy, and what strings will be attached to their largesse.",Reframe the article to focus on future implications and predictions based on the events or information presented.,"The negotiations aim to craft a new treaty that will slow the gradual warming of the planet.

"There were several reports this month, based on former and current aides, that Mitt Romney is actively weighing another presidential run. The biggest sign yet comes from a recent interview with The New York Times, where the former 2012 Republican nominee offered a less than Shermanesque response to the million-dollar question.This was the obvious opening for me to ask if there was a chance. Romney's response was decidedly meta — ""I have nothing to add to the story"" -- but he then fell into the practiced political parlance of nondenial. ""We've got a lot of people looking at the race,"" he said. ""We'll see what happens.""Buoyed by good poll numbers and a wide-open prospective Republican field, Romney went farther than his ""circumstances can change"" reply in August, and certainly miles forward from the, ""Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no,"" answer in January.If he does throw his hat into the ring for a third time, the former governor of Massachusetts told the Times that he would employ a cameraman -- essentially his own tracker -- to follow him around in order to guard against statements that derailed his 2012 campaign. ""I want to be reminded that this is not off the cuff,"" Romney said.Romney said the tactic could potentially prevent another ""47 percent"" incident, which by his telling, was nothing more than a problem of setting.""My mistake was that I was speaking in a way that reflected back to the man,"" Romney said.

"Obama has maintained neutrality in the primary and recently met with Clinton's opponent, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , at the White House.

"Donald Trump is surging in new battleground and national polls at a time when Hillary Clinton faces tough questions not only about her health but her sweeping criticism of her Republican opponent’s supporters.Several surveys appear to show the Republican presidential nominee effectively ending, at least for now, a post-convention slump that saw Clinton leading in virtually every swing state. Now, a Monmouth University Poll shows Trump taking a narrow 2-point lead in Nevada; a Bloomberg Politics poll shows Trump leading Clinton by 5 points in Ohio; and new CNN/ORC polls show Trump leading in Florida and Ohio.In the latter survey, Trump leads 46-41 percent among likely voters in Ohio, and 47-44 percent among likely voters in Florida.“We’ve really had a good month,” Trump told Fox News’ “Fox & Friends,” claiming he’s enjoying renewed “enthusiasm” from voters.Clinton, though, plans to return to the campaign trail Thursday afternoon after taking three days off to recover from a bout of pneumonia. While her campaign dispatched high-powered surrogates to the stump in her absence -- including Bill Clinton and President Obama -- the Democratic nominee’s presence could help reset the race once again.The contest remains tight, and the polls are hardly uniform. A Quinnipiac University national poll released Wednesday showed Clinton leading 48-43 percent among likely voters.But that still represents a narrowing of the race since a late-August survey showing Clinton up 10 points.The recent surveys come as Clinton grapples with new controversies on two fronts: Her comment at a Friday fundraiser that half of Trump’s backers are in a “basket of deplorables,” and her campaign’s handling of a health scare on Sunday during a 15th anniversary ceremony honoring victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.Clinton has since expressed regret for her “deplorables” comment, though Trump has called on her to outright retract it. And Clinton’s campaign has sought to answer questions about the former secretary of state's health, after Clinton was seen stumbling at the 9/11 memorial event in New York City.The campaign said she was overheated and dehydrated, and revealed she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. While the incident revived long-simmering questions about her health, the campaign on Wednesday released additional medical details.

"Lawmakers are fuming over claims that Capitol Police officers left their service weapons in bathrooms and other spots across the Capitol complex three times this year.In one instance, a child visiting the Capitol reportedly found a loaded Glock.""The fact that dangerous weapons were left in the open, potentially within reach of the general public, is unacceptable,"" said House Administration Committee Chairwoman Candice Miller, R-Mich., and Ranking Member Robert Brady, D-Pa., in a written statement.Fox News is told lawmakers will have a briefing on the incidents next week.For Washington's embattled security agencies, it's the latest embarrassing episode. The Capitol Police and other agencies already are under scrutiny over the incident last month where a man breached restricted airspace and landed a gyrocopter next to the Capitol.The incidents involving misplaced firearms were detailed in a report being reviewed by the Capitol Police Board.The newspaper Roll Call, which first reported the incidents, said one of the guns -- allegedly left by a member of House Speaker John Boehner's detail in a bathroom in March -- was found by a 7- or 8-year-old child.Another was found stuffed in a restroom stall in the Capitol Visitor's Center in January. It was discovered by a Capitol worker and belonged to a member of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's security detail.Custodial staff located a third weapon two weeks ago at the Capitol Police headquarters.These firearms are Glocks and do not have conventional ""safeties"" on them -- they will fire if the trigger is pulled.The concerns come as congressional officials are closely scrutinizing USCP Chief Kim Dine.

"Newly released video captured by an Arizona police officer’s body camera captures the chilling moment when a deranged suspect drew a gun and fired the bullet that killed the officer last month.Rookie Flagstaff Police Officer Tyler Stewart’s camera caught the entire, deadly encounter with Robert Smith, whose girlfriend had called police on Dec. 27 to report he had trashed her apartment. The video, released by the police department in response to Freedom of Information Act requests, begins with Stewart getting out of his squad car and ends with Smith pointing the gun at him and firing.Smith then shot himself dead, and Stewart, who was 24, later died at a hospital.""Officer Stewart was murdered by Smith without any provocation or warning,"" Sgt. Margaret Bentzen told the Arizona Daily Sun. ""There were no homicidal or suicidal indications from Smith prior to the crime.""The frightening, 14-minute video comes as the Justice Department is encouraging police departments around the nation to invest in the body cameras following high-profile cases in which police have been criticized, including last August’s police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.Stewart and Smith speak outside Smith's Flagstaff home on Dec. 27 for about three minutes as Smith stands with his hands in his jacket pockets. When Stewart asks him if he has any weapons on him, Smith replies, “No, sir. I'm just cold,” and says he only has “smokes” in his pocket.Stewart then calmly asks if he can check Smith for weapons. When he reaches toward him, Smith draws a .22-caliber revolver from his right pocket and fires six times at Stewart. Five shots hit Strewart, four in the head and one in the lower back.One of Smith's roommates told police that Smith had been contemplating suicide, according to police reports.Stewart had gone to Smith’s girlfriend’s home earlier, but the man who would later kill him was gone. The cop then went to Smith's home, where his roommate said Smith had fled, according to a police report. Records indicate that about an hour later, at 12.30 p.m., Smith called the Flagstaff Police Department and left a message for Stewart, who then went back to Smith’s home where the fatal encounter took place.“This is an enormous tragedy for our department and the family of our officer,” Flagstaff Police Chief Kevin Treadway told AZ Central. “We are a very close-knit organization, and know that all members of the Flagstaff Police Department are grieving at this time.”Release of the frightening footage raises questions about balancing the public's right to know against privacy concerns of police officers and their families, according to Levi Bolton Jr., executive director of the 14,000-member Arizona Police Association. On Wednesday, Bolton met with state lawmakers to discuss the cameras and how best to handle disclosure of footage that may show innocent bystanders, undercover police or informants or, as in Stewart's case, the final moments of an officer's life.""We are currently crafting or looking at legislation that may very well discuss this,"" Bolton told reporters. ""We acknowledge that the public and the media should have access to this information.""A fund to help Stewart's family has been established and those wishing to donate can do so at any Wells Fargo Bank, according to the Flagstaff Police Department.

"A former military intelligence officer claimed Tuesday that the White House was delaying the announcement of its decision to file desertion charges against Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was released by Taliban-aligned militants last year in exchange for five Guantanamo prisoners.In defending claims he originally made Monday on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" that Bergdahl would be charged, retired Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer told Bill O'Reilly that there was ""no doubt"" the White House was dragging out its decision.His original accusation had resulted in a strong denial from the Pentagon earlier in the day.""They said there's no time limit on this decision. (Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John) Kirby even said there's no pressure ... Of course, the moment you say that, there's pressure,"" said Shaffer, who works at the London Center for Policy Research. ""What they didn't say was more compelling than their denial.""Shaffer, who believes the White House's alleged decision to delay its announcement is politically motivated, added that he stands by ""all of those facts,"" referring to his report on Monday that Bergdahl's lawyer has been given a statement of charges.Kirby, meanwhile, on Wednesday stood by his claim that no charges have been filed. Asked whether there was political pressure to delay the charges, he said, ""that is the most ludicrous claim I've heard in the last few days.""Maj. Gen. Ronald F. Lewis, the Army's chief of public affairs, put out a statement Tuesday afternoon calling the reports, including a similar one by NBC News, ""patently false.""""To be clear there have been no actions or decisions on the Sgt. Bergdahl investigation,"" he said. ""The investigation is still with the commanding general of U.S. Army Forces Command who will determine appropriate action -- which ranges from no further action to convening a court martial.""Kirby earlier said Bergdahl ""has not been charged,"" and no charges have been referred. ""No decision has been made with respect to the case of Sgt. Bergdahl, none,"" he said. ""And there is no timeline to make that decision."" He said he would not ""speculate"" about what might happen in the future.Eugene Fidell, Bergdahl's lawyer, did not comment when reached by Fox News earlier Tuesday.Shaffer said Monday that Bergdahl's attorney has been given a ""charge sheet"" outlining the section of the military justice code Bergdahl allegedly violated.""As a corporate entity, the Army has decided that they want to pursue Bergdahl for this violation,"" Shaffer said.Shaffer said there's a ""huge battle"" going on inside the Obama administration, as some try to ""suppress"" this development. ""This is shaping up to be a titanic struggle behind the scenes,"" he said.Shaffer said the Army ""wants to do the right thing,"" but the White House ""wants this to go away.""He said: ""The White House, because of the political narrative, President Obama cozying up to the parents and because of he, President Obama, releasing the five Taliban ... The narrative is what the White House does not want to have come out.""Bergdahl was held for five years before his release was secured in 2014.But while the president joined with Bergdahl's parents in the Rose Garden at the time in celebrating his return home, the prisoner swap swiftly became a matter of severe controversy. Fellow soldiers accused Bergdahl of deserting his post on a base in Afghanistan in 2009. And the trade itself, of his freedom for five Guantanamo prisoners, drew criticism in Congress from lawmakers who said it sent a troubling signal.On Monday, former diplomat Richard Grenell claimed the administration has ""sent the message"" that the U.S. will negotiate on such matters. He cited an alleged offer, made around the same time as Bergdahl's release, by the Qatari government to trade two Americans held in Qatar for an Al Qaeda agent held in a U.S. federal prison. The Obama administration denies there was any deal. Those prisoners were ultimately released over the past two months.",Describe the events as if they were part of a historical epic tale.,"The tale unfolded like a gripping epic, shrouded in mystery and political intrigue.

"Why Negotiators At Paris Climate Talks Are Tossing The Kyoto ModelNegotiators and heads of state from nearly 200 countries are meeting for the next two weeks near Paris to craft a new treaty to slow global warming.It's the 21st ""Conference of the Parties"" held by the United Nations to tackle climate change. One treaty emerged, in 1997, after the conference in Kyoto, Japan. That's no longer in effect, and, in fact, the Kyoto Protocol, as it's known, didn't slow down the gradual warming of the planet.Now governments are ever more desperate to do something to slow warming — so much so that they've thrown out the model set in Kyoto and opted for a new approach for Paris.Valli Moosa, a former climate negotiator from South Africa, says the main reason Kyoto failed to slow warming lies largely with who wasn't included in the treaty. ""You actually cannot have a meaningful agreement without China and the United States being part of it,"" he says.The U.S. Senate refused to ratify the Kyoto treaty, so the world's biggest greenhouse-gas emitter didn't have skin in the game. And developing countries, including China and India, were not required to reduce emissions. Now those countries are becoming the biggest sources of greenhouse gases as their economies thrive. China, in fact, is now the world's biggest emitter, and India isn't far behind. Moreover, the Kyoto treaty had U.N. bureaucrats and negotiators setting goals for the participating countries to lower their greenhouse gases. Many countries didn't make their targets; others dropped out. Economies were at stake, and few countries were comfortable marching to a U.N. beat.So what negotiators are bringing to the table at the Paris talks is an arrangement whereby each country is offering to reduce its own emissions by whatever amount it can manage. And everybody participates, not just developed countries.Most nations arrive with a reduction target already in hand. What will be difficult is deciding who will pay how much to developing countries to build economies that won't keep producing high emissions.French negotiator Laurence Tubiana points out that the key to success is convincing governments that those economies can be ""low-carbon,"" and that this won't be a bar to developing wealth. ""How much I'm sacrificing for the sake of emissions reductions, that's no more,"" she says of the message that negotiators are pushing. ""And now ... the Chinese, even the Indians are really coming in. It's about low-carbon economy.""Previous attempts to replace the Kyoto treaty have failed. This new approach is voluntary, and most of the world has agreed theoretically to participate, which negotiators hope will sweeten things enough to get a deal. Still to be determined, however, is who will pay for this massive revolution in the world's energy economy, and what strings will be attached to their largesse.","If the original text is opinionated, rewrite it to present the information in an unbiased, journalistic news format.","Negotiators and heads of state from nearly 200 countries are meeting in Paris for the 21st ""Conference of the Parties"" hosted by the United Nations to tackle climate change.

"LAS VEGAS  The Democratic presidential candidates are holding their first debate Tuesday night in Las Vegas.It marks the first time frontrunner Hillary Clinton and her main challenger so far  socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.  will appear on the same stage in this campaign, along with the other three candidates.This campaign was expected to be a cakewalk for the former first lady, but it hasn't turned out that way.One big reason seems to be the story that just won't away: how she used a private email server to conduct government business. It's fed a perception that she can play by a different set of rules.Even so, Clinton still has a decent lead nationally over the socialist senator from Vermont, but Sanders is coming on strong. He's beating her comfortably in the key state of New Hampshire and is close in Iowa, too.Plus, Sanders is the one drawing tens of thousands of people to his events. Democratic voters seem to be listening intently to his populist messages.With the threat from Sanders a reality, Clinton is now trying to reposition herself a little more leftward. Just recently she came out against President Barack Obama's big Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement.That's a reversal because while serving as secretary of state, she was for it. This new position puts her more in line with the liberal base of her party.""As of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it,"" Clinton said. ""I don't believe it's going to meet the high bar I have set.""So, tonight the drama will center on how much Sen. Sanders and the other Democrats confront Clinton directly on the debate stage.Expect former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley to be an instigator.

"Say what you will about Donald Trump, but the man is winner. Trump didn’t just wallop his opponents Tuesday — he crushed them. Up 41 percent in Delaware, 40 percent in Rhode Island, 37 percent in Pennsylvania, 33 percent in Maryland, 30 percent in Connecticut, he’s estimated to have won 110 delegates, versus five for Kasich and three for Cruz.If the race for the GOP nomination were a Little League game, the mercy rule would be imposed.Here’s where we stand today. Ted Cruz is mathematically eliminated from winning the Republican nomination before the convention in Cleveland. John Kasich has now won a single state — Ohio — where he is governor. If ever there were a series of states that would at least theoretically be fertile territory for him, it would be the Northeast, home of the last vestiges of Republican moderates. Yet, he didn’t crack 30 percent anywhere. Republicans can talk all they want about Never Trump and trying to stop him at the RNC in Cleveland. They can talk about changing the rules and holding out hope that a white knight candidate will emerge. It isn’t going to happen. Either Trump is the nominee or he’ll burn the whole thing to the ground. If you’re a gambler, go all in on the former.It is worth stepping back, however, and noting that Trump’s hammerlock over the party — and his ascendancy within the GOP — is astounding. He’s a political amateur who never held elected office; he’s a xenophobe, a bully, and a misogynist and he has run directly against the leadership of the party he hopes to lead. Yet, today he stands on the cusp of winning the nomination of the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Nixon, and Reagan. I know we’ve all become inured to Trump’s insults, his know-nothingness, and his crudeness, but it can’t be said enough — truly we are living in a political moment unlike anything that any of us has seen before.Here’s what might be even more amazing: Trump’s position as the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party is not the most remarkable political event this year. Rather, it’s that the Democratic Party is poised to nominate the first woman to be a major party candidate for president. Somehow this constantly seems to be forgotten; and whether you like Hillary Clinton or despise her, that America is poised to nominate a woman for president is a big deal.Tuesday night, Clinton racked up four more primary wins, including the delegate-rich states of Maryland and Pennsylvania. Only in Rhode Island did Bernie Sanders thwart her. Early on in the evening, before all the races had been called, he gave a “victory” speech in West Virginia that not only left unmentioned the evening’s results, but plowed forward with confidence about the road ahead. It’s a fitting metaphor for the Sanders campaign, which increasingly seems to operate in a realm completely divorced from reality. Sanders cannot and will not win the Democratic nomination. Period.Indeed, in her victory speech, Clinton — as she has increasingly done — simply ignored Sanders. Instead she aimed her daggers at her real target, Donald Trump. The Democratic race will continue, but for all intents and purposes, it is over. Clinton can now begin her pivot to the general election, and Sanders can play out the string.What we now with some certainty is that we’re only a few months away from an historic, unprecedented presidential campaign — and no matter which candidate wins on Election Day, history will be made.","Develop as an email newsletter to clients, highlighting key points and implications.","It covers various topics, including Trump's win, Cruz's elimination, Kasich's victory in Ohio, and the Democratic party's progress.**Key points:*** **Trump's overwhelming victory:** Trump won by a significant margin in several states, securing an estimated 110 delegates compared to five for Kasich and three"

"U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday’s unity march against terrorism.Kerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.The visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.The French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday’s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.Among roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.Kerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi’s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.In a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as “quibbling a little bit.” He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.“But that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,” he said.“And I don’t think the people of France have any doubts about America’s understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.”","Compose as a farewell speech from a key figure mentioned, reflecting on their journey.","S.

"President Barack Obama is proposing a new strategy in the fight against ISIS, saying the battle against the Islamic State will not be quick. In fact, he says it could take decades.During a rare visit to the Pentagon, Obama laid out his revamped strategy, saying the fight against the Islamic State will require more than just weapons.""No amount of military force will end the terror that is ISIL unless it's matched by a broader effort, political and economic,"" he said.The president said coalition forces will go after the heart of ISIS, but he did not call for more bombing or more troops, announcing instead a shift in focus to counter the terror group's public relations tactics.Obama pointed to a string of ISIS defeats in the region due to airstrikes targeting the group's supply lines. But he said more needs to be done to recruit and train Syrians for the fight on the ground.When it comes to lone wolf terrorists in America inspired by ISIS, the president admitted they're harder to detect, saying U.S. national security must remain vigilant.Obama pointed to increased efforts to counter ISIS's propaganda that's spreading worldwide via social media.""We also have to acknowledge that ISIL has been particularly effective at reaching out to and recruiting vulnerable people around the world, including here in the United States,"" he said.While the fight against ISIS will be long, the president said he's confident the terrorists won't win.But Republicans remain skeptical, saying Obama's plan doesn't go far enough.""A speech isn't a strategy,"" said Cory Fritz, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.

Cruz campaign spokeswoman Alice Stewart confirmed to CNN that the mailer was from the Cruz campaign.

""There is no such thing as an election violation related to frequency of voting.

"WASHINGTON -- The audience should have belonged to Sen. Rand Paul. After all, the thousand or so clean-cut millennials in the D.C.-area ballroom were members of Young Americans for Liberty, a student group founded by Paul’s father, former Rep. Ron Paul.The kids chuckled appreciatively as Rand unspooled his tart, college-dorm-room disdain for government. But he didn’t fire them up. Neither did Utah Sen. Mike Lee, the thoughtful-sounding son of a Reagan-era U.S. solicitor general.The man who got them cheering, who got them going, who got them roaring with derisive laughter and bubbling with anger at the depredations of liberals was: Sen. Ted Cruz.Striding the stage like Elvis (if Elvis had been a college debater at Princeton and a brilliant student at Harvard Law), Cruz was the firebrand whom the conserva-geeks wanted to either meet or become.That was more than a year ago, when the first-term senator from Texas was still in the hard-right afterglow of his bid to shut down the government in a vain (in both senses) attempt to stop Obamacare.But the Young Americans for Liberty loved his loathing of the party elders, and his determination to shove a stick between the spokes of the System.And it is that emotion -- across-the-board opposition to every “liberal” idea that exists, and disgust with the System in all of its manifestations -- that Cruz hopes to tap for the energy he thinks can somehow lift him to the presidency.Uncorked anger doesn’t usually win presidential nominations, let alone presidencies. People want hope and uplift in the White House and not just expressions of outrage. The president is the person who is supposed to make things work.To some, the 44-year-old Cruz gives off a vaguely scary aura of cheerful menace. For now, as Cruz officially announces his 2016 bid, he is nearly an asterisk in the early GOP polls, well behind somewhat less apocalyptic personalities, such as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.The first is that his angry approach may fit the times. Even as the voters depend more and more on government and politics -- perhaps for that very reason -- their regard for the machinery of both continues to plummet to new lows.Cruz beat the establishment in Texas like a drum. They hate him for it, but he is also going to raise a lot of cash in, yes, Texas.He is as pure an across-the-board conservative as it is possible to find in what has to be regarded as the big leagues of politics: culturally, fiscally, in monetary policy, in foreign policy.Cruz is triple 7s on the slot machine of issues: anti-abortion, a global-warming mega-skeptic, to the right of Likud on Israel, anti-immigration to the max, big on defense spending, etc.He is a libertarian, traditional conservative, war hawk and evangelical Baptist son of a preacher who fled Fidel Castro’s Cuba. There are plenty of philosophical and tactical contradictions in Cruz’s construct, but he ignores them all.","Reframe the article as a motivational speech, inspiring action or change based on the content.","The room was filled with young, clean-cut millennials, members of Young Americans for Liberty, a student group founded by the father of Sen.

"The federal government must make regular interest payments on the money it has borrowed to finance past deficits – that is, on the national debt held by the public.The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the federal government’s net interest payments on that debt will total $229 billion in the 2015 fiscal year. Working Americans end up having to foot that very large bill to varying degrees based on each individual taxpayer’s adjusted gross income.Click here to see your share of the federal debt.And the CBO expects that this challenge will accelerate over the next decade. Current interest rates are low by historical standards and higher interest rates means higher interest payments. It’s projected that net interest costs will more than triple over the next decade, reaching $808 billion in 2025.These numbers pose a real threat. The CBO has issued warnings about the serious negative consequences that such high and rising debt and interest payments on the debt could have on both the economy and the federal budget.“The large amount of debt might restrict policymakers’ ability to use tax and spending policies to respond to unexpected future challenges, such as economic downturns or financial crises,” the CBO said in a recent report.In the same report, they also cautioned that continued growth in the debt could lead investors to doubt the government’s willingness or ability to pay its obligations, which would require the government to pay much higher interest rates on its borrowing going forward.","Translate the article into a poetic format, capturing the essence and emotions of the story.","The government's borrowings, a debt,And interest payments, a heavy debt.The CBO estimates, a hefty sum,$229 billion, a hefty drum.Working Americans, the cost they pay,Based on income, they bear the sway.The debt burden grows, a threat,Tripling over the next"
"The Republican presidential candidates are seizing on the “top secret” Hillary Clinton emails in the final weekend before the Iowa Caucus, trying to slow their top Democratic rival by arguing her mishandling of the messages makes her unfit to be president.“Hillary Clinton is a major national security risk. Not presidential material!” GOP frontrunner Donald Trump tweeted after the State Department said Friday that it will withhold 22 emails from Clinton's correspondence as secretary of state because they are classified “top secret.”Trump and the 10 other Republican candidates are barnstorming across Iowa this weekend ahead of the Iowa Caucus on Monday, the first-in-the-nation balloting in the 2016 presidential race.Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, revealed last spring that she used a private server and email accounts for official business when she was the country’s top diplomat.The State Department has in compliance with a federal court order released thousands of page of Clinton emails, with classified information redacted. However the agency said Friday that the 22 top-secret messages, in seven email chains, will not be released.The intelligence community has deemed some of Clinton’s emails “too damaging"" to national security to release under any circumstances, a U.S. government official close to the ongoing review told Fox News.“The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton,” Trump also tweeted. “At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?”Clinton has repeatedly said she never sent classified information through her private accounts. Her campaign on Friday questioned the secrecy of the messages and called for the State Department to release them.The FBI is investigating the matter, which has raised questions about how federal agencies have different rules for classifying information and whether some of the emails were marked classified after the fact.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s top primary challenger, has declined to talk about the emails.There is a “legal process in place, which should proceed and not be politicized,"" he said Friday.During the first Democratic debate last year, Sanders famously dismissed the issue by saying, ""the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails!""He trails Clinton by rough 5 percentage points in Iowa but leads her by roughly 15 points in New Hampshire, which votes Feb. 9, according to the RealClearPolitics poll averaging.Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, running third in most GOP polls behind Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, told an audience in Clinton, Iowa, that such sensitive emails being on Clinton’s server is “not acceptable.”Cruz suggests that Clinton’s use of the private server and emails now appears “far more serious” than previously thought and that the most recent revelations put her candidacy into more peril.Cruz, who has 15 events in Iowa before the caucus, is also raising questions about whether the Justice Department, run by the Obama administration, would indeed indict Clinton, if the investigation leads to that decision.“There is an acceptance that the enforcement of criminal justice is decided not by the laws of this country, but by some political hack in the West Wing of the White House.That is not how our Constitution is meant to operate,” Cruz said on the Hugh Hewitt radio show.“If she is indicted, it is difficult to see how she could successfully run for president. I would put nothing past the gall and audacity of the Clintons to try. But even the Democratic Party, I would find it hard to believe that they would be eager to nominate someone who is under indictment and could well face felony incarceration.”Fox News' Catherine Herridge and Pamela K. Browne and The Associated Press contributed to this report.","Convert the article into a survival guide, using the events or information as a backdrop for survival tips.","As the Republican candidates seize on the issue, it's important to understand the situation and its potential impact on the race.**Survival Tips:****1.

"The State Department said Tuesday it has no record of Hillary Clinton signing a key form stating she turned over all official documents upon leaving the department -- a form that was the subject of intense speculation since the issue could determine whether she broke the law.That document is known as a ""separation"" form, which officials are supposed to sign upon leaving the department. It certifies that the person who signs it has turned over all ""classified or administratively controlled"" materials, as well as all ""unclassified documents and papers"" relating to official government business.Given that Clinton exclusively used personal email while secretary of state and didn't turn over official records until late last year, a former Justice Department official said last week that if Clinton signed that form, she probably gave a false statement and broke the law.But on Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters they are ""fairly certain she did not"" sign it.""We have reviewed Secretary Clinton's official personnel file and administrative files and do not have any record of her signing the OF109 [form],"" Psaki said.This admission comes after the department for days was unable to answer questions about whether Clinton signed the form.It also raises questions about whether Clinton, by not signing it, at least violated department policy.Psaki claimed Clinton did not violate any policy. Further, she said Tuesday that neither of Clinton's two immediate predecessors, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, signed such a statement either.She also said that different bureaus within the department had different rules relating to such statements that had the effect of making their completion optional by some employees.Shannen Coffin, a senior lawyer under the George W. Bush administration, first cited the form OF109 in questioning whether Clinton committed a violation by exclusively using personal email as secretary of state, and then not turning over those emails deemed work-related until after leaving the department.If she indeed signed the document, he told Fox News last week, ""there's no question [she broke the law].""And if Clinton did not sign that document, he added, ""why not?""The Associated Press contributed to this report.","Rewrite the text as a series of tweets, capturing the essence of the story in short messages.","**Tweet 1:**The State Department says they have no record of Hillary Clinton signing a key form stating she turned over all official documents upon leaving the department. #ClintonEmail**Tweet 2:**The ""separation"" form certifies that the person who signs it has turned over all classified or controlled materials and official documents. #ClintonForm**Tweet 3:**If Clinton signed the form, she probably gave a false statement and broke the law"
"Federal laws already allow people across the country the option to register to vote at the DMV. But Oregon and California's laws are pioneering because they do it automatically.It's hard to overstate how novel this concept is for the US. Throughout much of United States history, governments frequently put up barriers aimed at preventing people from voting, such as property ownership requirements, poll taxes, or literacy tests.Gradually, many of these barriers have fallen to make it easier for people to register. However, many states, including California, still close off registration weeks to a month before an election — an artificial obstacle that can prevent perfectly qualified people from voting if they simply miss a deadline.These new proposals remove those obstacles. Oregon's law will register all adult citizens in the DMV's database, while California's law will be implemented more gradually, as people get or renew their licenses or state IDs, or change their addresses. But both make it the government's responsibility to ensure that all eligible voters are registered.So it's a big deal that governments are now trying to make it easier and easier to vote, rather than more difficult. Matt Yglesias has argued for going even further and enshrining an affirmative right to vote in our Constitution — read his case here.In both California and Oregon, Republicans opposed these proposals, but generally didn't argue against the principle of easing registration. Instead, the criticisms have fallen along two main lines.First, critics have argued that since voter registration data is more publicly accessible than DMV information, automatically adding voters to the rolls could pose privacy concerns. However, supporters respond that people can always opt out.Second, some Republicans have cited concerns about voter fraud — usually about potential registration of unauthorized immigrants. But while California began issuing driver's licenses to unauthorized immigrants this year, these licenses are distinctively marked, and people with them would not be registered to vote automatically. And Oregon requires proof of citizenship for all driver's license applicants.Meanwhile, national Democrats are increasingly adopting mandatory voter registration as a major cause. In a speech on voting rights this June, Hillary Clinton called on all states to automatically register citizens to vote when they turn 18, unless they choose to opt out. And legislators in 15 other states have introduced bills similar to Oregon's new law — the Brennan Center is tracking them here.","Reframe the article to highlight environmental considerations, challenges, or impacts related to the events or information.","**Environmental Considerations:**- **Paper Consumption:** AVR requires the production and distribution of registration forms, which consume paper resources.- **Energy Consumption:** The processing and storage of voter registration data consume energy.- **Data Security:** AVR necessitates the collection and storage of sensitive voter information, which raises concerns about data breaches and privacy violations"

"During a House Appropriations Committee hearing, lawmakers added language to the 2016 defense spending bill stating that ""Congress has a constitutional duty to debate and determine whether or not to authorize the use of military force"" against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIL or ISIS.The amendment, offered by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), has no binding effect. It does nothing to force a congressional debate on the duration, costs or endgame of the war. It simply states that it is Congress' responsibility to have that debate and then vote to authorize, or not to authorize, war.""We must recognize that Congress has an important role to play in matters of war and peace. It's way past time to reassert Congress' role in war-making,"" said Lee. ""We can't allow this policy of endless war to continue. This amendment just says Congress has a constitutional duty to debate and determine whether to use military force against ISIL. A debate. Doing our job. That's all this amendment requires.""President Barack Obama has been directing airstrikes against ISIS since August, and he's been doing so without new congressional authorization. The Constitution requires Congress to declare wars, but in this case, Obama said he doesn't need lawmakers' sign-off because a sweeping 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force covers his actions. Lawmakers have disputed that point for months, so the president sent them a new, Islamic State-specific AUMF proposal in February, saying he welcomed a vote on it, even though he doesn't think he needs it.Democrats say Obama's proposal is too broad, Republicans say it's too restrictive, and their differences have given way to complacency. That leaves the U.S. engaged in a military campaign with no end in sight. The U.S. has already spent more than $2.1 billion, participated in more than 4,000 airstrikes and sent 3,000 military personnel to Iraq in the effort.The reality is that many lawmakers don't want anything to do with a war authorization vote, for fear that if something goes wrong, their fingerprints will be on it. A handful of Democrats have been pushing for a debate and a vote, but neither GOP nor Democratic Party leaders are doing anything to make the issue a priority.Tuesday's committee vote at least showed there is bipartisan support in the House for debating and voting on war authorization -- something House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has signaled isn't going to happen on his watch.""We are not only evading this responsibility on both sides of the aisle, quite frankly … but we are handing over war-making authority to the executive branch, to all future presidents, with both hands. It is a gigantic mistake not to do our job,"" said Cole.Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.) was among those who opposed Lee's amendment. He called it ""totally inappropriate"" to tie a war authorization measure -- even one that just states the role of Congress -- to the defense spending bill.Lee offered two other amendments that were rejected. One would have repealed the 2001 AUMF, with a cushion of eight months for Congress to pass a new, ISIS-specific AUMF in its place. The other would have repealed the 2002 AUMF that authorized the Iraq War. Neither of those AUMFs have an expiration date, and Obama has leaned on both as his legal justification for taking military action against ISIS on his own.","Reframe the article to highlight environmental considerations, challenges, or impacts related to the events or information.","One of the primary environmental concerns is the increased use of military force, which has resulted in a significant amount of air pollution and noise pollution.

"The Republican Party’s identity crisis keeps getting worse. Hours after House Speaker Paul Ryan said he was not ready to support Donald Trump, the presumptive G.O.P. nominee, 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney also refused to endorse his successor, saying that he was “dismayed” by the state of American politics and that he wished for “better choices” for candidates who, unfortunately, do not exist anymore.While Romney ruled out the possibility of a third-party candidacy during a Q&A at a fundraising gala Thursday night in Washington, he said he was so fundamentally disappointed with the G.O.P. that he could not support Trump in good conscience, nor would he switch allegiances and support Hillary Clinton.“I see way too much demagoguery and populism on both sides of the aisle and I only hope and aspire that we'll see more greatness,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.Earlier this year, Romney championed the Never Trump movement, attempting to block his nomination by proposing the remaining Republican candidates unite to force a contested convention in which an alternative would win the nomination despite winning fewer primaries. That dream ended earlier this week when Ted Cruz dropped out of the race (and John Kasich soon after), but that didn’t stop Romney from sticking to his convictions.“I happen to think that the person who is leading the nation has an enormous and disproportionate impact on the course of the world, so I am dismayed at where we are now,” he said. “I wish we had better choices, and I keep hoping that somehow things will get better, and I just don't see an easy answer from where we are.”Romney also praised Ryan, his former running mate, who recently took on Trump. “He is where he needs to be,” he explained, saying that he was impressed that Ryan could somehow get the wildly fractious House G.O.P. to work together. “I’d love to see him run for president, but having a Speaker of the House, at this stage, where we don’t know what’s going to happen on the presidential race, having a Speaker of the House with that kind of leadership capacity is very encouraging. I have hopes that he’ll remain Speaker.”Romney may not be the first Republican leader to publicly disavow Trump since he became the party’s nominee—that honor goes to Nebraska senator Ben Sasse, who quickly argued that an “adult” step in and run for president on a third-party ticket—but he is by far the most prominent. So far, there have been rumblings within an embarrassed G.O.P. that they could never support Trump: both George H.W. Bush and his son George W. Bush refused to endorse or comment on the nomination, and do not plan on attending the Republican National Convention. Senator John McCain was recorded saying that Trump would severely hurt his re-election chances in Arizona, a Latino-heavy state that borders Mexico. And, as Hillary Clinton highlighted in an e-mail blast, that sentiment isn’t limited to high-profile Republicans, either: dozens of other G.O.P. congressional representatives, governors, and major political figures are all quickly boarding the anti-Trump train—or, at the very least, refusing to comment.","Convert the article into a detective's notebook, piecing together clues from the story.",The Republican Party's identity crisis continues to worsen.

"That’s not to say that his campaign was especially successful. Many observers felt Kasich was pursuing a replay of former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman’s failed 2012 bid for the Republican nomination. Huntsman and Kasich even shared a campaign architect, the heterodox GOP strategist John Weaver. The playbook may have gotten Kasich farther than it did Huntsman, but that still wasn’t enough to win the nomination, or even to come close. (As for Huntsman, he now backs Trump .)While hardly anyone predicted Trump’s success in the Republican campaign, few expected Kasich would get this far either. In a crowd of young, charismatic GOP figures, Kasich was the odd man out, a somewhat more grizzled figure who had run abortively for president in 2000, and a comparatively moderate figure in a party trending increasingly to the right. Somehow, Kasich managed to hold on to the bitter end, the final challenger to Trump.The Ohio governor’s exit leaves Donald Trump as the last man standing in the Republican field. Though he’d already assumed the mantle of presumptive nominee with Senator Ted Cruz’s exit Tuesday night —after Trump trounced both of them in the Indiana primary—Kasich’s exit seals the deal. Kasich has been mentioned for weeks as a potential vice-presidential candidate for Trump, who will need to shore up his policy and political credentials ahead of the general election.John Kasich will end his bid for the presidency Wednesday afternoon in Columbus, according to multiple reports. Kasich had planned to hold a press conference at Dulles Aiport near Washington Wednesday morning, but he never took off—perhaps an apt metaphor—staying home and scheduling a press conference for 5 p.m., where he is expected to make his announcement.For a time, before Trump’s ascendancy became inevitable, Kasich’s plan seemed plausible. In New Hampshire, the nation’s first primary and second nominating contest, he placed (a distant) second to Trump, and hoped to portray himself as the reasonable alternative to the entertainer. But having placed a huge bet on the Granite State, Kasich had little infrastructure in place for the rest of the campaign, and was a non-entity in the South Carolina primary. By the time the campaign reached his home state, Kasich was effectively out of the running. Ohio turned out to be the only state that he won. He closes out the campaign with fewer delegates than Senator Marco Rubio, who dropped out on March 15.Kasich’s sell to voters was that amid a sea of volatile, unpredictable characters like Trump and wild-eyed radicals like Cruz, he was an old-style true conservative who could also win swing states like Ohio. To the extent that his campaign had a policy theme, it was his advocacy for a balanced-budget amendment—a vague promise, tethered to his work on balancing the national budget while in the U.S. House in the 1990s. (Opinions about just how central Kasich had been in that work differed widely.)But some of his other policy stances were at odds with much of the Republican Party. As governor, he had circumvented the GOP-led Ohio legislature to accept Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. As though that were not bad enough, he compounded his offense in the eyes of conservatives by justifying his choice by faith. “Now, when you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, he’s probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small,” he said. “But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor. You better have a good answer.’”Many of Kasich’s former colleagues viewed his image as a soft, cuddly, friendly politician with skepticism—they remembered a more irritable, angry Kasich—it seemed to take with many voters. The problem was that Republican primary voters didn’t want a sane, rational nominee in 2016. They wanted a Trump.","Create a mindfulness meditation script, inspired by the themes of the article.","While his journey was marked by a unique blend of grit and moderation, it ultimately fell short of the Republican nomination.Kasich's campaign was characterized by a sense of déjà vu, as many observers felt he was attempting to replicate the failed bid of former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman in 2012.

"Washington (CNN) Donald Trump backed off a false claim Friday morning, admitting he had not seen a video of a $400 million payment being unloaded from a US plane in Iran.The Republican nominee had claimed at rallies twice this week that such a video existed, saying in Maine on Thursday that it was provided by Iranians ""to embarrass our president because we have a president who's incompetent.""What Trump had actually seen in news reports was video of three American prisoners who Iran had released arriving in Geneva, Switzerland.Trump admitted his error in an early-morning tweet Friday, without actually saying he was wrong.""The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!"" he tweeted.The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!It was a rare reversal for Trump, who has stood by inaccurate or unproven claims previously -- insisting he'd seen videos of Muslim Americans in New Jersey cheering the September 11, 2001, attacks. His political rise began during the 2012 campaign, when he insisted that Obama release his birth certificate, questioning the President's American citizenship.Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine hit Trump on Friday for the video claim, saying he seems ""confused"" on CBS' ""This Morning,"" in an interview taped before Trump backtracked.""I have no idea what he's talking about. It (the video) doesn't exist. He might be thinking about Iran Contra from like 35 years ago or something like this,"" Kaine said.He pointed to Trump's recent criticism of Kaine, who Trump said in a late-July news conference ""did a terrible job in New Jersey"" -- despite Kaine being a governor and senator from Virginia, not New Jersey.

Right? You saw that? With the airplane coming in -- nice plane -- and the airplane coming in, and the money coming off, I guess. Right? That was given to us, has to be, by the Iranians,"" Trump said in Portland, Maine.""And you know why the tape was given to us? Because they want to embarrass our country.

"The White House and Republican leaders in Congress face long odds in trying to revive trade legislation after a telling defeat engineered by President Barack Obama's fellow Democrats.Obama's ambitious trade agenda is in serious doubt, as is his quest for a capstone second-term achievement.Without the power to negotiate trade deals that Congress can approve or reject, but not amend, Obama has little chance of securing the Pacific Rim pact that his administration has worked toward for years.Friday's rebuff highlighted the strained relations between Obama and congressional Democrats, who voted down a worker assistance program crucial to the negotiating authority measure just hours after the president implored them not to.Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, had worked in rare tandem on this issue, yet their inability to deliver raises the question of whether much else will get done with Republicans running Congress and Obama in the White House for the next 18 months.""This isn't over yet,"" Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., a main supporter of the trade legislation. ""I'm hopeful that the Democrats understand the consequences and get together with the president and finish this as soon as possible.""House GOP leaders took steps that would allow another vote on the worker retraining program in coming days, but that would require at least 90 votes to shift.Republicans sounded pessimistic that they could add many more votes for a program that most on their side deride as wasteful and unnecessary.House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California and her labor-backed allies are determined to oppose the Trade Adjustment Assistance program as a way to collapse the entire package. So it seems unlikely that enough Democratic votes would emerge to save the program, even though the party has promoted it for years.""Some of my Democratic colleagues are in danger of self-immolation"" on the workers' program and ""I think that's sad,"" said Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., one of the few Democrats who backed Obama on Friday's votes.Another possible route is to send revised legislation back to the Senate. But senators approved the larger package only narrowly last month after intense battles, and the White House desperately wants to avoid giving opponents there another chance to strangle the legislation.White House press secretary Josh Earnest dismissed Friday's outcome as an ""entanglement"" and ""procedural snafu.""But it was more than a ""snafu"" that caused Pelosi and the majority of House Democrats to revolt against their president.The White House, congressional Republicans and business groups argued that the special negotiating power is a necessary tool for trade deals opening up crucial markets to American goods.Union-backed House Democrats never bought the argument. They felt burned by promises from past administrations about trade deals they blame for job and manufacturing losses in their districts.Trade bills have always had a tough road in Congress. After election losses in recent years the House Democratic caucus is smaller and more liberal, attuned to economic issues in the wake of the financial sector meltdown and recession.Against that backdrop Obama was not able to bring enough House Democrats his way.

"President Obama defended his administration’s approach to the terror threat at a White House summit Wednesday, standing by claims that groups like the Islamic State do not represent Islam -- as well as assertions that job creation could help combat extremism.Obama, addressing the Washington audience on the second day of the summit, said the international community needs to address “grievances” that terrorists exploit, including economic and political issues.He stressed that poverty alone doesn’t cause terrorism, but “resentments fester” and extremism grows when millions of people are impoverished.“We do have to address the grievances that terrorists exploit including economic grievances,” he said.He also said no single religion was responsible for violence and terrorism, adding he wants to lift up the voice of tolerance in the United States and beyond.Obama’s address came as Republican lawmakers and others criticized the administration for declining to describe the threat as Islamic terrorism.State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf has also come under fire for suggesting several times this past week that more jobs could help address the terrorism crisis.On Tuesday, Rob O'Neill, former Navy SEAL Team 6 member who claims to have fired the shot that killed Usama bin Laden, told Fox News: ""They get paid to cut off heads -- to crucify children, to sell slaves and to cut off heads and I don't think that a change in career path is what's going to stop them.""Obama also called on Muslim leaders to “do more to discredit the notion that our nations are determined to suppress Islam, that there is an inherent clash in civilizations.”Obama acknowledged that some Muslim-Americans have concerns about working with the government, particularly law enforcement, and that their reluctance “is rooted in the objection to certain practices where Muslim-Americans feel they’ve been unfairly targeted.”He said it was important it make sure that abuses stop and are not repeated and that “we do not stigmatize entire communities.” He also said it was vital that “no one is profiled or put under a cloud of suspicion simply because of their faith.”Although Obama called for a renewed focus on preventing terrorists from recruiting and inspiring others, some thought his message seemed to miss the mark.“He was meandering, unfocused and weak,” said Richard Grenell, former U.S. spokesman at the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration and a Fox News contributor. “He was talking about isolating terrorists. He doesn’t understand the threat that we face… People are being burned in cages and he’s talking about more investments?”Sen.

"After his shotgun wedding to the presumptive GOP nominee last week, the House speaker is getting a glimpse of his future with a man who puts his dreams before anyone else’s.There’s no currently available evidence showing that Donald Trump’s entire campaign is just one big, deliberate effort to troll Paul Ryan.Since Ryan allied himself with the mogul, Trump has engaged in some of his worst behavior of the cycle, and his backers show no restraint in their eagerness to malign and mock the Speaker of the House. Any hoped-for Trump/Ryan Era of Good Feelings?On June 2, Ryan endorsed Trump. He said he made that decision because he believes a President Trump will help pass his forthcoming agenda.“Through these conversations, I feel confident he would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people’s lives,” Ryan said. “That’s why I’ll be voting for him this fall.”One day later, Donald Trump welcomed Paul Ryan to the rest of his life by saying the federal judge overseeing a civil case against the now-defunct Trump University is unsuited for the job because he’s of Mexican ancestry (said judge, Gonzalo Curiel, was born in Indiana).Ryan responded to the comments in a press conference he held in Southeast D.C. to roll out the first item on his policy agenda, a series of proposals to fight poverty.The focus of the morning could have been on the fact that House Republicans finally decided to start talking about poverty—an issue their party has long declined to focus on. But the biggest news Paul Ryan made was his response to Trump.“Saying a person can’t do their job because of their race is sort of the textbook definition of racist comments,” he said, saying Trump’s comments on Curiel “should be absolutely disavowed.”“I’m not going to even pretend to defend them,” he added. “I’m going to defend our ideas. I’m going to defend our agenda. What matters to us most is our principles and the policies that come from those principles, and our ability to give the people of this country a better way forward.”Tuesday’s press conference, was suppose to highlight Ryan’s latest attempt to turn the page away from the insanity of the presidential election and back to the serious business of lawmaking. He has spent the past few weeks cutting campaign-style videos teasing the release of a series of proposals from House Republicans.The sad irony of all this is that Trump actually paid lip service to Ryan’s anti-poverty plan when he appeared on CBS’s Face the Nation on June 5.“Paul Ryan—well, I think we will agree on—as an example, he really focuses on poverty,” Trump told host John Dickerson. “He wants to take people out of poverty. So do I. And we’re going to come up with a plan.”But that comment was totally drowned out by the criticism Trump drew for saying on the same show that a Muslim judge would probably be just as unfair to him as a judge of Mexican ancestry.",Summarize the key points as if explaining to a curious ten yours old.,"The House Speaker, Paul Ryan, recently endorsed Donald Trump and welcomed him to the rest of his life. However, the relationship between the two has been marred by some controversial comments and events.One of the most significant issues is Trump's recent remarks about a Mexican-American judge. He said that the judge is ""unsuited"" for the job because of his ancestry. Ryan condemned these comments as racist and said he will not even pretend to defend them."
"Implausible schemes to put Mike Pence, rather than Donald Trump, on the top of the ballot have been flying since a once-secret recording of Trump’s lurid boasting about sexual assault leaked to the public on Friday evening.Pence has issued a public statement on Trump’s remarks, saying he “does not condone his remarks and cannot defend them” — but accepted Trump’s apology and suggested he’d stick by him through the second presidential debate on Sunday night. Anonymous sources say privately Pence is “beside himself” over the details in the leaked audio.Meanwhile, multiple prominent Republicans — from former rival for the nomination Carly Fiorina to former Bush Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and a number of members of Congress — have called for Trump to step aside and allow Pence to be the nominee.On some level, the Republican longing for Pence in the face of these new details about Trump’s past makes sense. He’s an experienced politician with a long track record. He has impeccable social conservative credentials. He’s the governor of a state. He can pay attention in a debate long enough to land punches on Tim Kaine. And he has almost certainly never been secretly recorded talking about a woman’s “tits” or “pussy” or bragging about kissing women against their will.But if Republican politicians are really horrified by Trump’s remarks — and not just by the possible electoral implications — Pence made one decision that should disqualify him in their eyes, too: Mike Pence agreed to be Donald Trump’s vice president.Pence lent Trump the legitimacy he needed to unite the Republican Party. He spent months apologizing for Trump, explaining what Trump really meant, and doing everything he could to put Trump in the Oval Office.Trump himself pointed to “party unity” as one of the key reasons for choosing Pence as his running mate in the first place, making no secret of the role he viewed the Indiana governor as playing in the campaign.It’s not as if Pence didn’t know what he was doing. By the time Trump picked him as his running mate on July 14, Trump had already:Nor was Trump’s rampant sexism a secret. His public feuds with celebrities aside, the New York Times had already published a long article on times Trump was accused of crossing boundaries with women in his private life.And, of course, Trump had spent years publicly doubting that President Obama was born in the United States.This is not a complete list. But by the time Trump was picking a running mate, it was clear that he was a man with a history of bigoted, racist, sexist behavior and remarks. This is what Pence agreed to make palatable to the Republican establishment, to social conservatives, and to swing voters.Pence was going against his own principles, as these tweets from before he joined the ticket show:And Pence has stood by Trump throughout the ensuing controversies — Trump’s fights with a Gold Star family and the 1997 Miss Universe among them. He’s watched Trump tell black voters that they should vote for him because “What do you have to lose?” and say that the Central Park Five, proved innocent by DNA evidence, should have been executed anyway.To characterize Pence as a paragon of respect and decency who happened to wake up one morning and, through no fault of his own, be Trump’s running mate ignores the role Pence played in trying to make Trump palatable to voters and the establishment in the first place.If the case against Trump’s presidency is his poor judgment and his lack of respect for women, what does Pence’s tacit approval of all of this say about him?",Reframe the article to focus on innovative solutions or positive actions that are being taken or could be taken in response to the issues discussed.,"The recent controversy surrounding Donald Trump's lurid boasting about sexual assault has cast a shadow over the Republican party.

"The State Department said Tuesday it has no record of Hillary Clinton signing a key form stating she turned over all official documents upon leaving the department -- a form that was the subject of intense speculation since the issue could determine whether she broke the law.That document is known as a ""separation"" form, which officials are supposed to sign upon leaving the department. It certifies that the person who signs it has turned over all ""classified or administratively controlled"" materials, as well as all ""unclassified documents and papers"" relating to official government business.Given that Clinton exclusively used personal email while secretary of state and didn't turn over official records until late last year, a former Justice Department official said last week that if Clinton signed that form, she probably gave a false statement and broke the law.But on Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters they are ""fairly certain she did not"" sign it.""We have reviewed Secretary Clinton's official personnel file and administrative files and do not have any record of her signing the OF109 [form],"" Psaki said.This admission comes after the department for days was unable to answer questions about whether Clinton signed the form.It also raises questions about whether Clinton, by not signing it, at least violated department policy.Psaki claimed Clinton did not violate any policy. Further, she said Tuesday that neither of Clinton's two immediate predecessors, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, signed such a statement either.She also said that different bureaus within the department had different rules relating to such statements that had the effect of making their completion optional by some employees.Shannen Coffin, a senior lawyer under the George W. Bush administration, first cited the form OF109 in questioning whether Clinton committed a violation by exclusively using personal email as secretary of state, and then not turning over those emails deemed work-related until after leaving the department.If she indeed signed the document, he told Fox News last week, ""there's no question [she broke the law].""And if Clinton did not sign that document, he added, ""why not?""The Associated Press contributed to this report.","Compose the article as a debate, presenting opposing viewpoints on the issues discussed.","**The issue of Hillary Clinton's potential violation of the law related to the handling of official documents has sparked a debate, with opposing viewpoints on the matter.**Prosecution:**- Former Justice Department official believes that if Clinton signed the ""separation"" form, she probably gave a false statement and violated the law.- The form certifies the turnover of all official documents, and Clinton's exclusive use of personal email and late turnover of records cast doubt"

After months of negative publicity, hate mail, death threats and loss of income, the Gortz Haus Gallery went out of business last year.""The ugly continues to come at us, but I wouldn't want to be anywhere else and we would do it all over again the same way because we are in the middle of God's will,"" Betty told CBN News.Since last summer's Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, more than 100 religious freedom bills have been proposed in 34 states to protect Christians and others from the threat of legal action because they object to gay marriage on religious grounds.Take for example the new law just passed in Mississippi.""The Mississippi law says if you believe marriage is the union of one man and one woman, that sex is reserved for marriage and that we are created male and female -- it doesn't say you have to believe those things -- but it says if you do believe those things, we are not going to penalize you if you act on those beliefs,"" explained Dr. Ryan Anderson, a senior fellow with the Washington, D.C-based Heritage Foundation.In Louisiana and Ohio, lawmakers are also proposing measures that protect pastors who refuse to perform same-sex marriages.Anderson said the accusation that these religious freedom laws are discriminatory against gays and lesbians just isn't true.""I think the basic argument here is that we are trying to protect pluralism, we're trying to protect diversity, we're promoting tolerance,"" he said.But some of the laws have been met with fierce opposition from businesses, activists and celebrities.For instance, North Carolina's governor was forced to roll back portions of a controversial new state law after several companies criticized the law and others threatened to stop their businesses in the state.""I think this just shows you that what's taking place is a form of cronyism, it's cultural cronyism,"" Anderson said. ""Big business is using their marketing freedom to deny little businesses and religious people their religious freedom.""What is clear though is that the backlash from last year's Supreme Court decision has brought religious freedom concerns to the forefront this spring.Many Americans believe that the battle over gay rights versus protecting people's religious convictions is just beginning.","Incorporate economic analysis into the article, discussing the financial implications of the events or information.","The economic implications of this debate are multifaceted and complex. On the one hand, the potential loss of income for businesses that discriminate against gay couples could have a significant impact on the overall economy.

"Donald Trump easily won the Washington state primary on Tuesday, but his victory was overshadowed by violence outside a rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where protesters smashed windows and threw rocks at police.With 73% of votes counted in Washington, Trump had won 76.2% of primary voters. John Kasich and Ted Cruz, both of whom have dropped out of the race, had won 9.9.% and 10.1% respectively.Trump’s victory leaves him only needing a few dozen more delegates to reach the magic number of 1,237 required to cement the Republican nomination.Outside Trump’s rally in Albuquerque, protests against the presumptive nominee turned nasty on Tuesday night, with protesters overturning crowd control barriers and throwing rocks at police.There were early posts on social media reporting gunshots and tear gas, but the Albuquerque police department said those were inaccurate. Nonetheless, police horses were deployed to control the large crowd of protesters, and some reports showed pepper spray being used. The door to the convention center where Trump was speaking was also smashed.More than an hour after Trump had finished speaking and left for California, where he will campaign for the next few days in the run-up to the state’s 7 June primary, hundreds of protesters still thronged the streets, waving Mexican flags, lighting fires and chanting.Trump is the only remaining candidate campaigning for the Republican nomination, but Kasich and Cruz were also on the ballot in Washington, having suspended their campaigns after the ballots were printed.Dr Ben Carson was also on the ballot because he reportedly never officially submitted a withdrawal of his candidacy to the state.The state delegation, which was selected on Saturday at the state convention in preparation for the primary, is composed almost entirely of supporters of Cruz, whose supporters overwhelmed the state convention in Pasco.Despite this, the delegates are bound by state party rules to vote for Trump on the first ballot at the national convention, US senate candidate and former chairman of the Washington state Republican party Chris Vance, who was at the convention, told the Guardian.However, with seven upcoming primaries, including New Jersey and California, Trump is expected to easily overtake the delegate mark needed to win the nomination on the first ballot at the convention in Cleveland in July, avoiding a contested convention.In a strange quirk of party politics, the Democrats also held a presidential primary in Washington on Tuesday, but it didn’t matter in the slightest because the Democratic delegation from Washington was already settled by a caucus in March, at which Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton 73% to 27%.Interestingly, in the Democratic primary – which was admittedly meaningless as it has no bearing on the number of delegates as opposed to the caucuses – Clinton won comfortably, 53.63% to 46.37%, implying that perhaps Democratic voters want the primary season to be, finally, over with.","Compose the article as a recipe, metaphorically cooking up solutions or ideas mentioned.",**Ingredients:*** Political landscape of the United States* Trump's victory* Protests and violence* Kasich and Cruz's withdrawal* Trump's delegate lead* Upcoming primaries* Democratic primary**Instructions:**1. **Cook the political landscape:** Begin

"BREAKING: Black-clad gunmen stormed the Paris offices of a satirical newspaper known for lampooning Islamic radicals early Wednesday, killing 12 and injuring as many as 15 before escaping, French officials said.As many as three Kalashnikov-toting shooters were being sought after the attack at Charlie Hebdo, the newspaper known for challenging Muslim terrorists with a 2011 caricature of Prophet Mohammed on its cover and which recently tweeted a cartoon of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Two policemen and several journalists - including the cartoonist behind the newspaper's provocative images, were among the dead.“We’ve avenged the honor of the prophet!” the killers shouted, according to witnesses who spoke to Sky News. The gunmen spoke French without any accent, according to Le MondeThe gunmen fled in a stolen car, and may have quickly ditched it and disappeared into the French capital's subway system, according to reports. A pedestrian has been injured by the terrorist’s vehicle, and there has been a second shootout, according to Le Figaro.French President Francois Hollande branded the attack an act of terrorism and claimed that several other potential terror attacks had been thwarted ""in recent weeks."" Hollande added that the newspaper had been threatened in the past and was already under police protection and surveillance.“This is a terrorist attack, there is no doubt about it,” Hollande told reporters.Elsewhere in France, newspaper offices, shopping centers, museums and stations were placed under police protection.Officials said the men walked into the ground floor of the newspaper's offices and began shooting before making their way up to the first floor. As they fled the scene, they shot at arriving policemen.“It was a real butchery,” Rocco Contento, a spokesman for the Unité police union, told The Guardian.Benoit Bringer, a journalist from the agency Premieres Lignes Tele, whose offices are next door, told the Telegraph he took refuge on the building's roof.""Three policemen arrived by push bike, but they left naturally as the attackers were armed,"" he said.The newspaper's offices are in the trendy 11th arrondissement of Paris, which includes posh restaurants and retail shops.Charlie Hebdo's offices were firebombed in 2011 after a spoof issue featuring a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad on its cover.

Williams is from the St. Louis area and had been on probation for receiving stolen property.Williams had been involved in protests on the evening that the shooting occurred and had ""acknowledged"" firing shots, according to McCulloch.

"The water crisis in Flint, Mich., is just the tip of the iceberg – and if you think that it can’t happen in your community, you’re sadly mistaken. The aging water infrastructure in this country is deeply flawed. Many of the 150,000 public water systems that serve more than 300 million people are based on rusting, leaky pipes and decades-old plans that— if not corrected and replaced— will have devastating and long-lasting effects on our communities.The disaster in Flint, which began in 2014 when the city switched its water supply from Detroit’s system to the Flint River in a cost-saving measure, is likely brewing in many other communities. It is inconceivable to me that in the most developed nation on the planet, we have exposed families and young children to the poisonous effects of lead. And it is almost criminal to me that water supply officials were unaware that the water pumping through a large American city was endangering the community. That level of negligence is beyond comprehension.The dangerous, detrimental effects that lead can have on a developing brain and body are well-documented. In 1978, a largely successful campaign to remove lead from home paint products resulted in a new law, after it was found that small children could mistakenly eat paint chips and be exposed to lead poisoning. When it comes to levels of lead in water, no true amount is safe. However, in 1991 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established an action level for lead in public drinking water at 15 micrograms per liter, and required water supplies to routinely test household tap water to check lead levels.These laws and others were established to protect our citizens from both indirect and direct exposure to the harmful compound. A person can be directly exposed to lead by drinking contaminated water with unsafe levels, while indirect exposure can occur when a person inhales contaminated water particles through steam or vapors.Once lead enters the human body, the heavy metal attaches itself to cells that can begin to build up in bones or major organs like the liver or kidneys. It disrupts the normal cellular biology of the organ and can lead to chronic diseases. However, the most dangerous damage lead poisoning can inflict is on the brain, especially in young or unborn children. If lead is deposited in a developing fetal brain, it can disrupt the normal function and cause irreversible damage. The same can happen in young children whose brains are still maturing.The consequences can result in low IQ, severe delays in cognitive function, significant disruption in the memory center of the brain, learning disabilities and other neurological deficits. The devastating part of this diagnosis is that it is, for the most part, irreversible. Patients exposed to acute lead poisoning can be treated through chelation, which is a method used to filter out the lead. However, for children chronically exposed over a period of time, the damage cannot be undone.This makes the preventable crisis in Flint all the more devastating.I read that the Obama administration is planning to pick Dr. Nicole Lurie to act as a “czar” and fix the crisis in Flint, but I urge her to look further than just Michigan. Lurie and others must start to seriously evaluate other areas of America where the people are most susceptible to a disaster such as this. The government failed the city of Flint, it must act now to protect the rest of us.Dr. Manny Alvarez serves as Fox News Channel's senior managing health editor.

"U.S. counterterrorism officials are reviewing databases of known terror suspects and other materials after the deadly Paris shooting Wednesday morning, as the Obama administration opened the door to increasing security in the U.S. in response.The terror attack on a satirical French publication known for lampooning Islam left at least 12 dead, and the attackers remain at large. U.S. officials already are in touch with their French counterparts.The attackers reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar,"" Arabic for ""God is great, before escaping.Two French officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, named the suspects to the Associated Press as Frenchmen Said Kouachi and Cherif Kouachi, in their early 30s, as well as 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad, whose nationality wasn't immediately clear.One of the officials said they were linked to a Yemeni terrorist network.All three remain at large.Cherif Kouachi was convicted in 2008 of terrorism charges for helping funnel fighters to Iraq's insurgency and sentenced to 18 months in prison.Fox News is told investigators had been reviewing terror databases, including for individuals who have traveled to Syria. They also looked to closed-circuit television and evidence from the crime scene.In addition to identifying the suspects, the focus will be on determining whether this is isolated or part of a series of attacks.It is thought to be an attack carried out by a small cell, which distinguishes this from recent lone-wolf attacks, including one in Ottawa, Canada, and another more recent attack in Sydney, Australia. Officials are looking at the level of premeditation, given eyewitness accounts that the gunmen asked for individuals by name as they stormed the office.In addition, Fox News is told the assailants showed skill and familiarity with their weapons, and their escape also showed premeditation.A Department of Homeland Security official told Fox News that the department is ""closely monitoring"" the situation.""DHS will not hesitate to adjust our security posture, as appropriate, to protect the American people,"" the official said, urging the public to report suspicious activity to law enforcement.However, the office of the U.S. Embassy in France tweeted that there are ""no plans"" to close the embassy in Paris or other diplomatic facilities in France despite ""misleading"" press reports.U.S. investigators are expected to get more formally involved, but only after a request from the French government.Based on conversations with government officials and analysts, they are looking at three categories of suspects: self-radicalized individuals; members of Al Qaeda and its affiliates, specifically Al Qaeda's offshoot in North Africa known as AQIM; and those who have traveled to Syria and gotten training from Al Qaeda or the Islamic State.The latest edition of Inspire magazine, from the Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen, calls for attacks on France, as well as America and other allies.Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., told Fox News he has confidence in French authorities who are pursuing suspects as well. ""I would think that one way or the other, they will find them,"" he said.King also said the attack should be a ""wake-up call"" for Congress not to cut funding for DHS, despite an ongoing fight over funding the administration's immigration initiatives.Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C.

"(CNN) A baby who had heart surgery at St. Mary's Medical Center in Florida died Tuesday, at least the ninth infant to pass away after such a procedure since the program opened at the end of 2011.A CNN investigation calculates that from 2011 to 2013, the program had a 12.5% mortality rate for open heart surgeries, which is more than three times the national average.""Why won't they stop?"" asked Nneka Campbell, whose baby daughter, Amelia, died after heart surgery at the hospital.The same day the latest baby died, St. Mary's CEO Davide Carbone wrote a letter to employees about the CNN investigation, which aired Monday night, expressing support for the program and its heart surgeon, Dr. Michael Black.""The patients we serve are afflicted with severe life-threatening conditions, and it is impossible to eliminate the risk of mortality,"" he wrote.The hospital, which is owned by Tenet Healthcare, says CNN did not get the mortality rate right, but won't say what the hospital believes the correct rate is.Last year in April, the Florida Department of Health sent a team of expert heart doctors to St. Mary's to review the children's heart surgery program. The head of the panel, Dr. Jeffrey Jacobs, a professor of cardiac surgery at Johns Hopkins, suggested they stop doing heart surgeries on babies younger than 6 months.The baby who died Tuesday, Davi Ricardo Brandao, was only a few weeks old when he had surgery in March for a severe heart defect called truncus arteriosus, according to his mother, Pautilia Gomes. She said her son needed a second surgery later that month.In April, in response to an inquiry from CNN, St. Mary's spokeswoman Shelly Weiss said a patient with truncus arteriosus at St. Mary's was ""recovering well and the prognosis is good.""Davi never left the hospital and was not quite 2 months old when he died. Gomes posted a picture on her Facebook page of an eye filled with tears and the word ""LUTO,"" which is Portuguese for ""mourning.""According to St. Mary's, the hospital received the experts' final reviews last year in June. In his letter to employees, Carbone said that since that time, ""our mortality rate has been consistent with the national average, and does not significantly exceed the mortality rate of other programs as the CNN story alleges.""He did not say what the hospital's mortality rate was, or whether it included Davi's death. An email from CNN to Weiss went unanswered Wednesday.In his review last year, Jacobs, the Johns Hopkins surgeon, noted that St. Mary's was doing too few pediatric heart surgeries -- a very complex type of operation -- to get good at it. He noted that in 2013, the hospital did 23 procedures. The vast majority of hospitals in the United States that perform these surgeries do more than 100 a year, and anything less than that is considered low volume by the Society for Thoracic Surgeons.In response to CNN's investigation, Florida's Department of Health and the Agency for Health Care Administration issued a statement Wednesday saying, ""Florida does not regulate the number of procedures performed at pediatric cardiac programs"" and that the Agency for Health Care Administration ""continues to closely monitor St. Mary's to ensure that they are following the law.""","Write a satirical piece, exaggerating the article's themes for comic effect.","The heart surgery program at St. Mary's Medical Center in Florida has been a death trap for infants, with a mortality rate that's more than triple the national average.

"Islamic State militants have acknowledged for the first time that they have been defeated in the Syrian town of Kobani, blaming withering airstrikes by a U.S.-led coalition for forcing them to flee the town on the Turkish border.Although not a strategic site itself, Kobani — known by the militants as Ayn al-Islam — had turned into a test of wills between the militants and the coalition. At one point, Islamic State fighters controlled almost all of the town of 45,000 people and were on the verge of capturing it outright.In a video released late Friday by the pro-Islamic State Aamaq News Agency, two fighters made it clear that the coalition's relentless air assault proved too much for the militants.""A while ago, we retreated a bit from Ayn al-Islam because of the bombardment and the killing of some brothers,"" said one masked fighter who spoke Arabic with a North African accent.In the video, he vowed to return to drive out the People's Protection Units known as the YPG, the main Kurdish militia in Syria, that the fighter referred to as ""rats.""""The Islamic State will stay. Say that to (President) Obama,"" he said, pointing toward destruction on the edge of Kobani.A second fighter, standing on a road with a green sign sprayed with the name Ayn al-Islam, described the incessant pounding by coalition aircraft.""I swear by God, their planes did not leave the air, day and night; they did airstrikes all day and night,"" he said on the video. ""They bombarded everything, even motorcycles; they have not left a building standing. But, God willing, we will return and we will have our revenge multiplied.""Speaking at a meeting with his Mexican and Canadian counterparts in Boston on Saturday, Secretary of State John Kerry said recapturing Kobani was a ""big deal,"" AFP reported.""We have a long way to go in the overall campaign, but Daesh — ISIL as some know it — has said all along that Kobani was a real symbolic and strategic objective,"" Kerry said. ""So pushing them out of there is a big deal. And make no mistake, we will also use the same tools that we used to get there — the tools of cooperation and support — to defeat violent, transnational criminal organizations, and ensure that the rule of law thrives for all of our people.""The Islamic State launched its offensive on the region surrounding Kobani in mid-September, capturing more than 300 Kurdish villages and parts of the city while driving out more than 200,000 Kurds.The United States and several Arab allies began striking back and providing air cover for Kurdish militia to pour in from Turkey. The overall allied campaign aims to roll back the Islamic State militants who have taken over about a third of Iraq and Syria and declared the captured territory a new caliphate.As a result of the airstrikes and stiff resistance from the Kurds, the Islamic State — also known as ISIL or ISIS — began retreating a few weeks ago and lost more than 1,000 fighters, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors deaths in the Syrian civil war.In the last days of the fight, activists reported that the militant group was sending inexperienced fighters and teenagers to the front line because of a lack of recruits, the human rights group said. By Monday, activists and Kurdish officials reported the town was almost cleared of the militants.The four-month battle for Kobani, which was pummeled by airstrikes, mutual shelling and booby-trapped vehicles, left large parts of the town city uninhabitable, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.""It's not a city anymore,"" Bulent Kilic a Turkish photojournalist for the AFP news agency told Time.

"WASHINGTON -- The Senate advanced legislation Monday night to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, even though President Barack Obama has already said he would veto it.The Senate voted 63-32 to clear a procedural hurdle and begin debate on the bill. Ten Democrats and one independent, Angus King (Maine), voted with every Republican to move the bill forward. Those Democrats included Sens. Michael Bennet (Colo.), Tom Carper (Del.), Bob Casey (Pa.), Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), Joe Manchin (W.Va.), Claire McCaskill (Mo.), Jon Tester (Mont.), Tom Udall (N.M.) and Mark Warner (Va.). A final vote is expected later this week.Despite the strong vote, the Senate lacks the two-thirds majority vote needed to overcome a veto. The House passed the bill last week by a vote of 266 to 153 -- also shy of the 290 votes needed to clear a veto.Congressional action on Keystone comes after the Nebraska Supreme Court cleared the way last week for the proposed pipeline's route through the state. The Obama administration had been waiting for the Nebraska ruling to render its own decision on the pipeline, which is still forthcoming.White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Friday that the State Department is examining the court's decision as part of its process to evaluate whether the Keystone XL Pipeline project serves the national interest.""As we have made clear, we are going to let that process play out,"" Schultz said.

"Under new overtime rules, employees will be injured as well.The Labor Department’s change to the overtime rule is a harsh blow to millions of small businesses and their employees. According to NFIB research, approximately 44% of small businesses would be affected. The department claims that 4.2 million workers could potentially benefit from the change. That’s not consistent with the department’s own analysis.In fact, buried within the regulation, the department projects that many workers won’t receive any additional pay and that others will lose pay. According to Labor, 60% of the newly eligible employees don’t work overtime right now. The department also estimates that the average hourly pay rate will decline in 2017. The talking points say this is a raise for workers, but the economic analysis says something completely different.Most small businesses have razor-thin margins, and they cannot simply raise prices to cover higher costs without losing customers. Moreover, the median personal income for small business owners is roughly $68,000 annually, according to NFIB research. Big corporations can trim shareholder dividends, cut CEO pay or move production facilities out of the country. Those aren’t options for most small firms.Employees will be injured as well. Managers who haven’t punched a clock in years will have to go back to filling out a time sheet. They will even have to take into account work from home such as checking email or fielding a phone call. Essentially, they’ll be demoted from their management positions to hourly jobs.The overtime rule is another government mandate that makes it costlier and more difficult to run a business and create jobs. NFIB surveys its members every month to identify their top concerns. Government regulations consistently rank at the top.Every minute that business owners must devote to keeping records, filling out paperwork and dealing with government inspectors is a minute they don’t have to run their businesses.

"Cruz’s remarks came soon after House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) decided to bring up a “clean” bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, backing down from the effort to use department funding to strip authority for Obama’s executive actions.""Since December, the outcome has been baked in the cake. It was abundantly clear to anyone watching that leadership in both houses intended to capitulate on the fight against amnesty,"" Cruz said, adding, ""It was a strategy doomed to failure. It’s an old adage in Washington: Never take a hostage you’re not prepared to shoot.""Cruz's comments referred to the decision made in December 2014 to stall funding only for DHS, which made that agency the GOP's major source of leverage in the immigration battle. The Texas Republican pointed out that he earned the ""animosity and ire"" of his colleagues at that time because he supported threatening to shut down government agencies.""There was no chance, zero, that Republicans were going to fail to fund the Department of Homeland Security because Republicans care deeply about homeland security,"" Cruz continued.But Cruz failed to note that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had vowed to prevent all federal agencies, not just DHS, from shutting down. The shutdown strategy was doomed by the fact that the Senate has too few Republicans to overcome opposition from Democrats, who are against the method of using government funding to target White House policies. As a result, McConnell and Boehner had few practical options to achieve Cruz's objective of standing up to Obama through a shutdown.Still, Cruz implied the leaders did not try very hard, saying they should at least have chosen a better hostage.""If we had been serious about this fight, and we should have been, the continuing resolution [under which DHS funding expired in February 2015] should have focused on the EPA, or the IRS or the Department of Labor,"" Cruz said. ""Now, those are departments which a majority would be prepared to allow funding to temporarily expire in order to use as leverage.""When a reporter pointed out that Cruz himself did not take advantage of an opportunity in last week's battle to delay funding a little longer, the senator defended himself, saying: ""I have fought against executive amnesty at every stage using every tool that is available. Leadership has made the decision to capitulate.""""We see a pattern over and over again. When Republicans are running for office, they tell their constituents they will be conservative, they will honor and defend the Constitution, they will follow through on the principles their constituents are trusting them to follow through upon,"" Cruz said.

"President Barack Obama is proposing a new strategy in the fight against ISIS, saying the battle against the Islamic State will not be quick. In fact, he says it could take decades.During a rare visit to the Pentagon, Obama laid out his revamped strategy, saying the fight against the Islamic State will require more than just weapons.""No amount of military force will end the terror that is ISIL unless it's matched by a broader effort, political and economic,"" he said.The president said coalition forces will go after the heart of ISIS, but he did not call for more bombing or more troops, announcing instead a shift in focus to counter the terror group's public relations tactics.Obama pointed to a string of ISIS defeats in the region due to airstrikes targeting the group's supply lines. But he said more needs to be done to recruit and train Syrians for the fight on the ground.When it comes to lone wolf terrorists in America inspired by ISIS, the president admitted they're harder to detect, saying U.S. national security must remain vigilant.Obama pointed to increased efforts to counter ISIS's propaganda that's spreading worldwide via social media.""We also have to acknowledge that ISIL has been particularly effective at reaching out to and recruiting vulnerable people around the world, including here in the United States,"" he said.While the fight against ISIS will be long, the president said he's confident the terrorists won't win.But Republicans remain skeptical, saying Obama's plan doesn't go far enough.""A speech isn't a strategy,"" said Cory Fritz, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.

"Ashton Carter Is Sworn In As Obama's 4th Defense SecretaryThe cold and snow that walloped Washington overnight didn't stop Ashton Carter from reporting for work Tuesday. Carter was sworn in as the 25th U.S. Secretary of Defense after starting his day with meetings at the Pentagon.Sworn in by Vice President Biden at the White House Tuesday, Carter formally replaces Chuck Hagel, becoming President Obama's fourth defense chief in the past six years.Carter's debut at the Pentagon this morning was briefly interrupted when his wife, Stephanie, ""slipped and fell on the icy pavement,"" the AP reports. ""She laughed it off, and officials indicated she was not injured.""In taking the Pentagon's top job, Carter rounds out a career that has included several stints with the Department of Defense, from leading the acquisitions unit to being deputy defense secretary.NPR's John Burnett gives an overview of Carter's biography:""Ashton Carter is 60 years old; he's a Yale graduate and was a Rhodes Scholar in theoretical physics at Oxford.

"Encouraged by a new poll giving him a double-digit lead in the state and eager to pivot to the general election, the Republican front-runner stressed the importance of Indiana's Tuesday GOP primary more than he or his top advisers have previously.""Indiana is so important and we have to win it,"" Trump said to a crowd of approximately 1,500 people packed into a theater here in Terre Haute, Indiana. ""If we win Indiana, it's over.""While also echoing his top advisers' comments that he can clinch the nomination without Indiana's 57-delegate prize, Trump urged Indiana Republicans to put him over the top -- a victory that would solidify Trump's increasingly clear path to winning the GOP nomination on the first ballot of the party's summer convention.Still, Trump didn't relent in his attacks against the Texas senator, whom Trump accused of being a liar. Trump also focused on Cruz's now non-existent path to winning the GOP nomination on the first ballot of the convention and mocked Cruz for announcing a running mate , former GOP candidate and businesswoman Carly Fiorina , under those circumstances. Cruz can only stake a claim to win his party's nomination if he can keep Trump from clinching the 1,237 delegates needed before the party's July convention.""I've been saying that!"" Trump exclaimed.Cruz was born in Canada to an American citizen mother -- his Cuban-born father later became a citizen. Trump has that used to claim Cruz is not a ""natural-born citizen"" and therefore ineligible to be president.The Cruz campaign did not respond to a request for comment.A win in Indiana Tuesday could depress Trump's rivals' hopes of keeping him from the 1,237 delegate mark necessary for a GOP nomination win. Trump suggested Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- who formed a pact with Cruz to stay out of Indiana and focus on other states -- might drop out if Trump triumphs in the Hoosier State.That, Trump said, would give him a chance to try and bring much-needed unity to a fractured Republican Party.""It's really important that we win because if we win -- you know, we want to raise money for the party and we want to raise money for the Senate races and the congressional races and do a lot of things instead of wasting our time with these people,"" Trump said.But Trump's ongoing primary battle didn't stop him on Sunday from knocking the former secretary of state repeatedly before a rowdy crowd of Hoosier supporters.Still, he pressed a plea for Indiana voters to deliver him a victory Tuesday that he said would empower him to focus on Clinton.""Please.

"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump appeared to have made inroads with evangelical voters after meeting with hundreds of conservative Christian leaders Tuesday, but not all Christians are in his corner.Religion News Service came out with a list of seven conservative Christian leaders who are not supporting Trump.Topping their list is Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission. Moore referred to Trump's campaign as ""reality television moral sewage.""The report also named Denny Burk, a professor of biblical studies at Boyce College. Burk blogged in March, ""I am not joking or being hyperbolic when I say that he is a Mussolini-in-waiting. He must never be allowed near the Oval Office.

"Say what you will about Donald Trump, but the man is winner. Trump didn’t just wallop his opponents Tuesday — he crushed them. Up 41 percent in Delaware, 40 percent in Rhode Island, 37 percent in Pennsylvania, 33 percent in Maryland, 30 percent in Connecticut, he’s estimated to have won 110 delegates, versus five for Kasich and three for Cruz.If the race for the GOP nomination were a Little League game, the mercy rule would be imposed.Here’s where we stand today. Ted Cruz is mathematically eliminated from winning the Republican nomination before the convention in Cleveland. John Kasich has now won a single state — Ohio — where he is governor. If ever there were a series of states that would at least theoretically be fertile territory for him, it would be the Northeast, home of the last vestiges of Republican moderates. Yet, he didn’t crack 30 percent anywhere. Republicans can talk all they want about Never Trump and trying to stop him at the RNC in Cleveland. They can talk about changing the rules and holding out hope that a white knight candidate will emerge. It isn’t going to happen. Either Trump is the nominee or he’ll burn the whole thing to the ground. If you’re a gambler, go all in on the former.It is worth stepping back, however, and noting that Trump’s hammerlock over the party — and his ascendancy within the GOP — is astounding. He’s a political amateur who never held elected office; he’s a xenophobe, a bully, and a misogynist and he has run directly against the leadership of the party he hopes to lead. Yet, today he stands on the cusp of winning the nomination of the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Nixon, and Reagan. I know we’ve all become inured to Trump’s insults, his know-nothingness, and his crudeness, but it can’t be said enough — truly we are living in a political moment unlike anything that any of us has seen before.Here’s what might be even more amazing: Trump’s position as the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party is not the most remarkable political event this year. Rather, it’s that the Democratic Party is poised to nominate the first woman to be a major party candidate for president. Somehow this constantly seems to be forgotten; and whether you like Hillary Clinton or despise her, that America is poised to nominate a woman for president is a big deal.Tuesday night, Clinton racked up four more primary wins, including the delegate-rich states of Maryland and Pennsylvania. Only in Rhode Island did Bernie Sanders thwart her. Early on in the evening, before all the races had been called, he gave a “victory” speech in West Virginia that not only left unmentioned the evening’s results, but plowed forward with confidence about the road ahead. It’s a fitting metaphor for the Sanders campaign, which increasingly seems to operate in a realm completely divorced from reality. Sanders cannot and will not win the Democratic nomination. Period.Indeed, in her victory speech, Clinton — as she has increasingly done — simply ignored Sanders. Instead she aimed her daggers at her real target, Donald Trump. The Democratic race will continue, but for all intents and purposes, it is over. Clinton can now begin her pivot to the general election, and Sanders can play out the string.What we now with some certainty is that we’re only a few months away from an historic, unprecedented presidential campaign — and no matter which candidate wins on Election Day, history will be made.","Incorporate historical context into the article, comparing and contrasting the events or information with similar historical events or trends.","For example, you could mention the following:* The rise of Donald Trump's popularity and the impact it has had on the Republican Party.* The changing landscape of the American political landscape and the increasing polarization between the two major parties.* The historical significance of a woman being poised to nominate for president for the Democratic Party.Here's"
"The Obama administration has made ""virtually no progress"" to increase transparency and accountability for its lethal drone program, a new report has concluded, with only months left to spare before the White House hands control of the targeted killing apparatus to a successor.The report by the nonpartisan Stimson Center said the administration is failing to release fundamental information about the program or to significantly overhaul it — even after a 2015 strike mistakenly left American contractor Warren Weinstein and Italian hostage Giovanni Lo Porto dead.""We have seen relatively few successes,"" said Rachel Stohl, a researcher at the center. ""The administration has been unwilling to provide the number of strikes, even in aggregate; the number of civilian casualties that they estimate that have occurred because of those strikes; the legal justification, unless required by court order, that allows the program to continue; so even on the most basic levels, what is the program doing, we don't know.""A bipartisan task force called on the White House nearly two years ago to reconsider its reliance on targeted killing of suspected terrorists, in part, because the strikes may be doing more harm than good by fomenting hatred overseas. But Stimson researchers said they've uncovered little evidence anything like that reorientation has happened.A senior administration official told NPR the White House goes to ""extraordinary lengths"" to avoid civilian casualties.The official added: ""Unlike our enemies, which deliberately and pointedly violate the law of armed conflict, the United States takes great care to adhere to the fundamental law of armed conflict principle of distinction, which requires that attacks be directed only against military objectives and that civilians and civilian objects not be the target of attack.""At least nine nations now have weaponized drones, and four have used them, the report said. ""It's important that the United States establishes good policy and sets an international precedent that demonstrates leadership and responsibility and transparency over the program because other countries are going to follow the U.S. lead,"" Stohl said.U.S. government officials have walked a fine line on the drone program, which is supposed to be secret. Former CIA and NSA Director Michael Hayden addressed the strikes in his new book and an opinion article in the New York Times Sunday, when he wrote: ""I think it fair to say that the targeted killing program has been the most precise and effective application of firepower in the history of armed conflict.""Days earlier, lawyers for the Obama administration appeared in an appeals court in Washington, D.C., to fight a demand by the American Civil Liberties Union for legal justifications and ""summary strike data,"" including the numbers and identities of people killed by weaponized drones.Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the ACLU, said the administration can't have it both ways.""The law of the drone campaign should not be a secret, nor should the CIA be permitted to withhold basic information that would allow the public to understand the implications of the government's policies,"" Jaffer said. ""This is particularly the case since so many senior officials have spoken so freely about drone strikes.""","Rewrite the text as a series of tweets, capturing the essence of the story in short messages.","**Tweet 1:**The Obama admin has made ""virtually no progress"" to increase transparency and accountability for its lethal drone program.

"U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday’s unity march against terrorism.Kerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.The visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.The French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday’s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.Among roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.Kerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi’s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.In a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as “quibbling a little bit.” He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.“But that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,” he said.“And I don’t think the people of France have any doubts about America’s understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.”",Reframe the article to focus on innovative solutions or positive actions that are being taken or could be taken in response to the issues discussed.,"In response to the tragedy, various innovative solutions and positive actions are being taken or could be taken to address the issues at hand.One such initiative is the establishment of a global counter-terrorism network.

"Two climbers made it to the top of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park on Wednesday, the first ever to scale the 3,000-foot granite wall using only their hands and feet and safety rope.For 19 days, Kevin Jorgeson, 30, of Santa Rosa, Calif., and Tommy Caldwell, 36, of Colorado, attempted what many considered impossible on one of the world's most difficult climbs: Being the first to ""free climb"" the sheer face of El Capitan's Dawn Wall. They used safety ropes and harnesses to prevent deadly falls, but did not using ropes or climbing aids to reach the top. The two climbed the wall in 32 rope-length sections that climbers call pitches, and they reached the summit around 3:30 p.m. PT.Patagonia, the clothing and gear maker, sponsored the climb.Caldwell was the first to finish. He waited on a ledge for Jorgeson, who caught up minutes later. The two embraced before Jorgeson pumped his arms in the air and clapped his hands above his head. Then they sat down for a few moments, gathered their gear, changed clothes and hiked to the nearby summit.In the meadow below, a crowd broke into cheers. Caldwell's mother, Terry, said her son could have reached the top several days ago, but he waited for his friend to make sure they got there together.""That's a deep, abiding, lifelong friendship, built over suffering on the wall together over six years,"" she said.President Obama sent his congratulations from the White House Twitter account, saying the men ""remind us that anything is possible.""Each trained for more than five years, and they have battled bloodied fingers and unseasonably warm weather. The men often climbed at dusk or later, using headlamps to see, because the rock needs to be cold to keep fingers and hands from sweating and slipping.Jorgeson fell 11 times over seven days trying to get past one particularly tough section. He took to Facebook on Sunday to publicly celebrate his victory.""It took everything in my power to stay positive and resolved that I would succeed,"" he wrote.The climb began Dec. 27 and was expected to take two weeks. It is the realization of a dream that began seven years ago when Caldwell first began climbing the monster rock formation, he said.They've slept in portaledges — tents attached to the face of the wall.El Capitan, the largest granite monolith in the world, has about 100 routes to the top.

"""2014 was the planet's warmest year on record. Fourteen of the 15 hottest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century,"" Obama said. ""Yes, this winter was cold in parts of our country, including Washington. Some people in Washington helpfully used a snowball to illustrate that fact. But around the world, in the aggregate, it was the warmest winter ever recorded.""It's of course a huge coincidence that the visit is in the backyard of two Republican presidential hopefuls who have been squishy on the subject of climate change, and a Republican governor who reportedly told state employees they can't even use the words ""climate change.""""Climate change can no longer be denied,"" Obama said. ""It can't be edited out. It can't be omitted from the conversation. And action can no longer be delayed.""   Ahead of the visit, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on a call that Obama would ""use the occasion of Earth Day to highlight his commitment to fighting to protect public health and to fighting the carbon pollution that contributes to climate change."" And the president picked Florida, Earnest said, because it's a place ""where these kinds of issues have traditionally been bipartisan.""Earnest was coy about the fact that Florida also happens to be the home of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio, two likely Republican presidential contenders who haven't been as enthusiastic about climate action. Bush has said he's a ""skeptic"" when it comes to climate change, while Rubio says he doesn't believe human activity is causing the planet to heat up.The president, Earnest said on the call, hopes the visit ""will prompt an elevated political debate about making climate change a priority."" However, he added, the trip is ""not an effort to go to anyone's home state, but to raise the debate.""Earnest maintained that Obama's visit ""isn't about campaigns, this is about making progress on a priority."" But he also noted that ""the Republicans who choose to deny the reality of climate change, they do that to the detriment of the people they're elected to represent.""Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), also no big fan of the concept of climate change, has taken to Twitter to criticize Obama's Everglades visit. Scott argued that the president should do more to get federal funding for Everglades restoration, because, he said, ""Our environment is too important to neglect.""Earnest fired back against Scott on Wednesday. ""It's a little tough to take criticism from someone who has banned the words 'climate change' for the accusation that the president has been insufficiently committed to fighting climate change,"" he said, referring to reports that Florida officials were forbidden from using the terms ""global warming"" and ""climate change"" in official communications. ""That's a tough case to make, but it sounds like that didn't stop him.""The White House also used the occasion to tout the benefits of the National Park Service, which will celebrate its 100th anniversary next year.

"LAS VEGAS  The Democratic presidential candidates are holding their first debate Tuesday night in Las Vegas.It marks the first time frontrunner Hillary Clinton and her main challenger so far  socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.  will appear on the same stage in this campaign, along with the other three candidates.This campaign was expected to be a cakewalk for the former first lady, but it hasn't turned out that way.One big reason seems to be the story that just won't away: how she used a private email server to conduct government business. It's fed a perception that she can play by a different set of rules.Even so, Clinton still has a decent lead nationally over the socialist senator from Vermont, but Sanders is coming on strong. He's beating her comfortably in the key state of New Hampshire and is close in Iowa, too.Plus, Sanders is the one drawing tens of thousands of people to his events. Democratic voters seem to be listening intently to his populist messages.With the threat from Sanders a reality, Clinton is now trying to reposition herself a little more leftward. Just recently she came out against President Barack Obama's big Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement.That's a reversal because while serving as secretary of state, she was for it. This new position puts her more in line with the liberal base of her party.""As of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it,"" Clinton said. ""I don't believe it's going to meet the high bar I have set.""So, tonight the drama will center on how much Sen. Sanders and the other Democrats confront Clinton directly on the debate stage.Expect former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley to be an instigator. He's trying to get traction and has taken some shots at Clinton over the last few months.As for Clinton herself, she's trying to avoid a repeat of 2008 when she went in as the heavy favorite, then ran into a buzz saw called Barack Obama.This time around the buzz is growing for Bernie Sanders.","Transform the article into a fantasy tale, with elements of magic or myth intertwined with real events.","In the mystical realm of Las Vegas, where the veil of reality danced with the whispers of myth, the Democratic presidential candidates embarked upon a journey of their own.

I'm going to win, OK?"" Trump added. ""The answer is: I'm going all the way and I'm going to win.""Trump said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that he would get out of the race if his poll numbers plummeted and he had no chance of winning, setting off speculation among pundits that Trump might soon drop out of the GOP presidential contest.Trump remains the leading contender for the GOP nomination in all the major polls, but that lead has slipped in recent weeks as contenders like retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and businesswoman Carly Fiorina gain on the billionaire candidate.The latest poll in Iowa from NBC News/Wall Street Journal shows Trump leading Carson by just 5 points, down from a double-digit lead just weeks ago. And in New Hampshire, Trump's lead has also slipped to 5 points ahead of Fiorina -- down from 10 points just two weeks ago. Trump also took the opportunity Tuesday to once again slam Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, as a ""total lightweight"" and even knocked Rubio for past financial difficulties: ""Take a look at his past, he's got $12 in the bank."" ""Rubio is not the guy that's going to be negotiating with the kinds of people you have to negotiate with to turn this country around,"" Trump said. RELATED: First on CNN: Trump sent prank care package to Rubio Trump has been jabbing at the Rubio campaign in recent weeks, as the Florida senator got positive reviews for his debate performance last month and has risen in the polls. His campaign sent a case of ""Trump Ice Natural Spring Water"" to Rubio's headquarters, a dig at the time Floridian who once took a memorable gulp from a water bottle while giving the Republican response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address. Later on Tuesday, the Republican also defended his support for eminent domain, which allows government to seize private land and pays the owners in return. Some conservatives, such as the influential Club for Growth, which is attacking Trump for his position , oppose the power in order to protect property rights.

"The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., today is holding its first Sunday service following a horrific shooting that killed nine members of a Bible study group there.Dylann Roof, 21 — who has apparently expressed strong racist and white supremacist views — is charged in the Wednesday night killings, in which nine members of a Bible study group at the historic black church were shot dead. Emanuel AME's pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pickney, was among those killed.As parishioners and visitors fanned themselves against the heat of the first day of summer, the service opened at 9:30 a.m. EDT to filled pews. Hundreds more gathered outside the church.The service opened with the hymns ""Praise God, From Whom All Blessings Flow"" and ""Blessed Assurance.""The Rev. Norvel Goff said: ""we still believe prayer changes things. ... prayer not only changes things, it changes us.""""Many hearts are broken and tears being shed,"" he said. ""Through it all we are reminded that we serve a God who still cares.""Delivering the sermon later, he acknowledged ""it has been tough. It has been rough.

"President Obama has long been a friend of organized labor, wholeheartedly supported by unions that helped boost him to victory in both his presidential campaigns.But increasingly, there now is a divide between unions in the public and private sector when it comes to supporting him.According to James Sherk, a labor policy analyst with the Heritage Foundation, government employee unions want ""bigger and more expensive government,"" in contrast to private sector unions.Sherk added those private groups are ""pushing back"" and speaking out more publicly about things like the Keystone XL Pipeline, which they believe will benefit their members. That has put them on a collision course with Obama, who last summer proclaimed, ""We should do everything we can to strengthen unions in this country.""""The president's insistence on vetoing this pipeline is directly taking away income from these union members, and they, understandably, don't like it,"" Sherk said.Congress has passed a measure to expedite the Keystone project, although Obama has vowed to veto it. Just days ago, Sean McGarvey, president of North America's Building Trades Unions, made a direct appeal.""We urge the president of the United States to put our men and women back to work across the length of this pipeline as soon as possible,"" McGarvey said, adding, ""We urge the president to sign the bill.""Union leaders also have a long-standing beef with the administration over the Affordable Care Act's enormous tax on so-called Cadillac health insurance plans.The plans offer high dollar benefits and are used as a recruiting tool.Although the tax doesn't kick in for several more years, as far back as 2013 union leaders were making public pleas to Democratic lawmakers. In a letter written in July of that year, union officials, including James Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, urged congressional Democrats to drop the tax saying, ""We voted for you.We have a problem; you need to fix it.""Analysts say the issue may present an opportunity for GOP leaders to build some good will with unions.

"Donald Trump is surging in new battleground and national polls at a time when Hillary Clinton faces tough questions not only about her health but her sweeping criticism of her Republican opponent’s supporters.Several surveys appear to show the Republican presidential nominee effectively ending, at least for now, a post-convention slump that saw Clinton leading in virtually every swing state. Now, a Monmouth University Poll shows Trump taking a narrow 2-point lead in Nevada; a Bloomberg Politics poll shows Trump leading Clinton by 5 points in Ohio; and new CNN/ORC polls show Trump leading in Florida and Ohio.In the latter survey, Trump leads 46-41 percent among likely voters in Ohio, and 47-44 percent among likely voters in Florida.“We’ve really had a good month,” Trump told Fox News’ “Fox & Friends,” claiming he’s enjoying renewed “enthusiasm” from voters.Clinton, though, plans to return to the campaign trail Thursday afternoon after taking three days off to recover from a bout of pneumonia. While her campaign dispatched high-powered surrogates to the stump in her absence -- including Bill Clinton and President Obama -- the Democratic nominee’s presence could help reset the race once again.The contest remains tight, and the polls are hardly uniform. A Quinnipiac University national poll released Wednesday showed Clinton leading 48-43 percent among likely voters.But that still represents a narrowing of the race since a late-August survey showing Clinton up 10 points.The recent surveys come as Clinton grapples with new controversies on two fronts: Her comment at a Friday fundraiser that half of Trump’s backers are in a “basket of deplorables,” and her campaign’s handling of a health scare on Sunday during a 15th anniversary ceremony honoring victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.Clinton has since expressed regret for her “deplorables” comment, though Trump has called on her to outright retract it. And Clinton’s campaign has sought to answer questions about the former secretary of state's health, after Clinton was seen stumbling at the 9/11 memorial event in New York City.The campaign said she was overheated and dehydrated, and revealed she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. While the incident revived long-simmering questions about her health, the campaign on Wednesday released additional medical details. Dr. Lisa Bardack, Clinton’s physician, said she is “recovering well with antibiotics and rest.”Bardack also said Clinton remains “healthy and fit to serve.”Trump, too, has tried to answer questions about his own health. He discussed the results of a recent physical with TV’s “Dr. Oz,” and told Fox News on Thursday “they were good.” The discussion with “Dr. Oz” will air on his show Thursday.Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign maintains they always knew states like Ohio would be competitive – and they are building out their operation there.The campaign announced that they will open a half-dozen new offices in the state, bringing their total to 54.",Rewrite the text from the perspective of an inanimate object or animal mentioned in the story.,"As a proud and sturdy tree standing tall in the heart of the forest, I have witnessed the ebb and flow of the political landscape.

"U.S. counterterrorism officials are reviewing databases of known terror suspects and other materials after the deadly Paris shooting Wednesday morning, as the Obama administration opened the door to increasing security in the U.S. in response.The terror attack on a satirical French publication known for lampooning Islam left at least 12 dead, and the attackers remain at large. U.S. officials already are in touch with their French counterparts.The attackers reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar,"" Arabic for ""God is great, before escaping.Two French officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, named the suspects to the Associated Press as Frenchmen Said Kouachi and Cherif Kouachi, in their early 30s, as well as 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad, whose nationality wasn't immediately clear.One of the officials said they were linked to a Yemeni terrorist network.All three remain at large.Cherif Kouachi was convicted in 2008 of terrorism charges for helping funnel fighters to Iraq's insurgency and sentenced to 18 months in prison.Fox News is told investigators had been reviewing terror databases, including for individuals who have traveled to Syria. They also looked to closed-circuit television and evidence from the crime scene.In addition to identifying the suspects, the focus will be on determining whether this is isolated or part of a series of attacks.It is thought to be an attack carried out by a small cell, which distinguishes this from recent lone-wolf attacks, including one in Ottawa, Canada, and another more recent attack in Sydney, Australia. Officials are looking at the level of premeditation, given eyewitness accounts that the gunmen asked for individuals by name as they stormed the office.In addition, Fox News is told the assailants showed skill and familiarity with their weapons, and their escape also showed premeditation.A Department of Homeland Security official told Fox News that the department is ""closely monitoring"" the situation.""DHS will not hesitate to adjust our security posture, as appropriate, to protect the American people,"" the official said, urging the public to report suspicious activity to law enforcement.However, the office of the U.S. Embassy in France tweeted that there are ""no plans"" to close the embassy in Paris or other diplomatic facilities in France despite ""misleading"" press reports.U.S. investigators are expected to get more formally involved, but only after a request from the French government.Based on conversations with government officials and analysts, they are looking at three categories of suspects: self-radicalized individuals; members of Al Qaeda and its affiliates, specifically Al Qaeda's offshoot in North Africa known as AQIM; and those who have traveled to Syria and gotten training from Al Qaeda or the Islamic State.The latest edition of Inspire magazine, from the Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen, calls for attacks on France, as well as America and other allies.Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., told Fox News he has confidence in French authorities who are pursuing suspects as well. ""I would think that one way or the other, they will find them,"" he said.King also said the attack should be a ""wake-up call"" for Congress not to cut funding for DHS, despite an ongoing fight over funding the administration's immigration initiatives.Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C.

"U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday’s unity march against terrorism.Kerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.The visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.The French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday’s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.Among roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.Kerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi’s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.In a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as “quibbling a little bit.” He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.“But that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,” he said.“And I don’t think the people of France have any doubts about America’s understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.”","Transform the article into a series of frequently asked questions (FAQs) and answers, providing a clear and concise overview of the topic.",**FAQs and Answers:****Q: Why did U.S. Secretary of State John F.

"Ed Morrissey is senior editor at HotAir.com, a columnist for The Week and The Fiscal Times, and author of ""Going Red: The Two Million Voters Who Will Elect the Next President -- and How Conservatives Can Win Them."" The views expressed are his own.Traditionally, the spouses of major-party nominees get a speaking slot at the national convention to humanize the candidate. Former presidents speak to remind the faithful of their history. Bill Clinton falls into both categories, but he had a far more difficult task in closing out the second night of the Democratic convention in Philadelphia on Tuesday night; he needed to find a way to knit the party back together again.That's a tall order, and not just because the evening started with a walkout involving hundreds of Bernie Sanders delegates, according to one estimate . A generation has passed since the former president ascended to lead the Democratic Party as the first baby boomer major-party nominee, and then defeated the last of the World War II presidents.Back then, Bill used his enormous natural political talent to fuse the New Left with working class Democrats, while ""triangulating"" on the Republican agenda to carve a centrist path in governance.Twenty-four years later, it's not Bill Clinton's Democratic Party. It might not be Hillary Clinton's Democratic Party. If it hadn't been for the establishment-protecting superdelegates and the Democratic National Convention's efforts to tip the primary scales in her favor, it would likely have been Bernie Sanders' Democratic Party -- and on Tuesday in Philadelphia, with hundreds of empty seats staring back at the stage, it certainly looked as though it was.Twenty-four years later, Bill Clinton isn't the same, youthful physical force, either. At times he seemed frail and at one point a bit distracted. However, Clinton proved that his political instincts haven't dimmed much at all. Rather than take on the task of unifying through direct debate, Clinton delivered a masterful soft-sell by walking through a personal history of his wife that tried to answer the divides in the party.","Write a satirical piece, exaggerating the article's themes for comic effect.","com, a columnist for The Week and The Fiscal Times, and author of ""Going Red: The Two Million Voters Who Will Elect the Next President -- and How Conservatives Can Win Them.""

"In some gas stations around the country, the price of a gallon of regular has dropped below $1.42. AAA and GasBuddy, two organizations that follow gasoline prices, say that gasoline prices below $2 will not be unusual in most of the United States. As oil prices fall, and refinery capacity stays strong, the price of gas could reach $1 a gallon in some areas, a level last reached in 1999. As a matter of fact, the entire states of Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Caroline have gas prices that average at or below $1.75.Gasoline prices are driven mostly by four factors: oil prices, proximity to refineries, refinery capacity and state taxes and levies. Oil prices have dropped below $33 a barrel and continue to collapse. The recent decision by Saudi Arabia to continue to keep its oil exports high essentially has dissolved the OPEC cartel. The decision also has forced the kingdom to chop its 2016 budget. This ongoing supply glut guarantees oversupply of crude. At the same time, slowing national economies in the largest countries, including China, will lower demand. China now tops the list of oil importers, according to the Financial Times, having moved ahead of the United States.The cost of producing oil from shale deposits, particularly in the United States, is greater in some cases than what it can be sold for. Nonetheless, parts of this industry continue pumping, increasing supply, while others go bankrupt because they cannot survive with crude prices so low.Several states house large refineries or are close to those that do. This is particularly the case near the Gulf of Mexico, including the massive refinery operations south of Houston. Some owned by Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) process several hundreds of thousands of barrels per day. Proximity to refineries is a factor in gasoline prices, if the refineries are running at or near capacity and produce gasoline instead of other petroleum products.Finally, gas taxes in several states are well below the national average of $0.4869 a gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. In some low gas price states, these taxes are below $0.40. This includes South Carolina at $0.3515, Missouri at $0.3570 and Oklahoma at $0.3540. Low gas taxes in these states compound the effect of falling oil prices.The odds grow each day that gas prices will be $1 a gallon in some areas in the United States, particularly those where prices are already close to hitting $1.40 — and falling.24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

"North Charleston Police Officer Michael T. Slager, 33, can be seen shooting 50-year-old Walter Scott after a confrontation on Saturday, according to The Post and Courier. Slager chases Scott and shoots at him eight times in the video recorded by a passerby and obtained by The New York Times.The confrontation started when Slager had reportedly pulled over Scott because of a broken taillight. It escalated into a foot chase as Scott allegedly fled because there were family court-issued warrants for his arrest. Slager pursued Scott into a grassy lot and claimed that he fired his Taser to subdue him.Earlier this week, an attorney for Slager said the cop felt threatened after Scott tried to overpower him and take his Taser. Today that attorney told The Post and Courier that he's ""no longer involved"" in the case.But first images in the video are of Slager shooting at Scott as he runs away from him. It also appears that Slager drops the Taser near Scott after he was gunned down, according to The New York Times.Police reports also say that responding officers performed CPR and delivered medical aid to Scott, but the video shows Scott face down in handcuffs for several minutes after the shooting. Another officer shows up and appears to give Scott aid, but never performs CPR.Police Chief Eddie Driggers said Tuesday that Slager had been arrested. The U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement that FBI investigators would work with the State Law Enforcement Division, which typically investigates officer-involved shootings in South Carolina, and the state’s attorney general to investigate any civil rights violations in Scott’s death. Mayor Keith Summey added during a news conference that as a result of the video and Slager’s “bad decision,” the officer would be charged with murder.Scott had been arrested about 10 times in the past, mostly for failing to pay child support or show up for hearings, according to the paper.""He has four children, he doesn’t have some type of big violent past or arrest record. He had a job, he was engaged,"" a lawyer for Scott's family told the Times. ""He had back child support and didn’t want to go to jail for back child support.""In a statement released Tuesday night, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley (R) said, ""What happened in this case is not acceptable in South Carolina."" Senator Tim Scott (R) said ""The senseless shooting and taking of Walter Scott's life was absolutely unnecessary and avoidable,"" adding that he would be watching the case closely.The shooting in North Charleston comes on the heels of several high-profile cases of police officers using deadly force against unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, Cleveland and New York. This is one of the few times the offending officer has been charged with murder.""What if there was no video? What if there was no witness? Where would we be without that video,"" Justin Bamberg said at a presser with the family on Tuesday night. Bamburg is one of the Scotts' family attorneys and also represents South Carolina's House District 90.Family attorney L. Chris Stewart called the witness who recorded the video a ""hero,"" saying that video evidence disproved initial reports that Scott reached for the Slager's Taser. Stewart added that the witness is working with investigators and may eventually come forward.""If there was no video, I do not believe that officer would be in jail,"" Bamberg said. ""From what the video shows, I think that provides the necessary ammunition to hold this officer accountable.""""I don't think anybody can see that and not see that what that officer did was murder Mr. Scott in cold blood,"" Bamberg said.

"One of the big successes in US policing over the past three decades was the push to make law enforcement more data-driven. The big crime-tracking system that came out of this, CompStat, has been widely credited with helping cut crime in the US.But what if this approach has also led police to be too focused on data, turning policing into a numbers game in which cops try to make as many arrests as possible and manipulate the figures to look good?John Eterno, a retired New York City Police Department captain and associate dean and director of graduate studies in criminal justice at Molloy College, explained the problem in a new documentary by FiveThirtyEight:Initially, I think it was easier to bring down crime, because crime was so high. It's kind of like squeezing a lemon — when you squeeze a lemon, the juice is easy to come out initially. But over time, it's more and more difficult.… Commanders are under enormous pressures to make sure that the crime numbers go down. And then the message filters down to the lower rank: If the captain's not doing well, or the inspector's not doing well, we're not doing well.This creates a perverse incentive at some police departments to make crime and policing numbers look favorable to the department at almost any cost. Officers could achieve this by, for example, purposely misinterpreting some crimes as non-serious offenses or not counting them altogether. That way, the mayor and police chief can claim that serious crimes are dropping when, in reality, some serious offenses are just being defined as non-serious or not counted at all.The numbers game also increases demand on cops to look like they're doing more to prevent crime. So officers are sometimes encouraged to stop or arrest as many people as possible so they can appear as if they're staying busy while on duty.And if some cops don't play along, commanders will try to make their lives harder — by, for instance, putting them on the graveyard shift or denying them promotions. Or, in one whistleblower's case, something much worse.The numbers game became a huge focus for the NYPD over the past few decades. And when officer Adrian Schoolcraft tried to expose the abuse, the NYPD retaliated — placing Schoolcraft in a psychiatric institution against his will for six days.Schoolcraft used a tape recorder to capture several examples of officers massaging the numbers at the NYPD. Here are some examples:But Schoolcraft's colleagues found out what he was up to. One day, when he got off work early, an emergency service unit came to his apartment, abducted him, and forcibly admitted him to a psychiatric ward.As they detained him, police discovered the recorder in Schoolcraft's pocket. One high-ranking official, Deputy Chief Michael Marino, couldn't believe it. ""Absolutely amazing,"" he said, according to the recording. ""When I came on the job, a cop would never dream of doing that to another cop for all the money in the world.""Schoolcraft later got the recordings to the Village Voice, a news weekly that broke the story. He is now suing the hospital that held him, as well as New York City and the NYPD.The story shows just how deeply ingrained the numbers game can be in some police departments: Officers are willing to take down their peers and sometimes friends just to avoid getting caught.""I believe they couldn't afford to have someone expose the behavior so bad, so criminal it would threaten their careers,"" Schoolcraft told New York City's ABC 7 in 2010. ""They reacted out of fear.""",Outline as a training manual for dealing with situations described in the article.,This creates a perverse incentive at some police departments to make crime and policing numbers look favorable to the department at almost any cost.**Here are some key takeaways from the article:*** **The numbers game is a problem in some police departments:** Officers are willing to take down their
"“Our fight for LGBT equality is not nearly over,” Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) stated emphatically in an interview with me last week on SiriusXM Progress. “And I’m hopeful, very hopeful, that the Supreme Court will say it’s unconstitutional to ban gay marriage. But that’s really just the beginning of fighting for our rights. We have to actually make sure all LGBT couples can have full parenting rights, have full social security and other federal benefit rights. We want to make sure companies can’t discriminate against members of the community because of who they love and who they are. And it’s really important [to take on] discrimination wherever it exists.”Toward that end, Gillibrand last week reintroduced the Every Child Deserve a Family Act, which she originally introduced in 2013 and which would bar adoption and foster care agencies that receive federal dollars from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. Though Gillibrand says she's seeking bipartisan support in the Senate and will continue speaking with Republicans, so far co-sponsors include a handful of fellow Democrats, such as openly lesbian Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is running for the Democratic nomination for the presidency.“Only seven states ban discrimination based on sexual orientation in adoption, and only five explicitly ban discrimination in foster care,” Gillibrand said in the interview. “So we have a long way to go. We only have a few states protecting LGBT parents. The reality is, there are two million LGBT individuals and families that are willing and able to take on these parenting obligations, to adopt these children or foster these children who desperately need it. Unfortunately, there are 400,000 children in the U.S. foster care system today and more than 20,000 of them are going to age-out before finding a permanent home. So we should be caring for these kids. We should give them the loving families they deserve.”The bill, if it becomes law, would only affect those agencies that take federal money, and they are free to opt-out from receiving funds.""If you’re getting the benefit of federal funds, you can’t discriminate,” Gillibrand said. “It’s unconstitutional, and you should not be able to use our taxpayer dollars to discriminate against individuals based on their sexual orientation and who they love. So I think it’s important we fight against it, particularly when our taxpayer dollars are being used.”“This legislation would prohibit adoption agencies and foster care agencies, including religious adoption agencies and foster care agencies, from providing services in many cases,” Lori Windham, Senior Counsel with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty told the Catholic news agency, EWTN News. Peter Sprigg, senior fellow for policy studies at the Family Research Council, is quoted in the same article saying there are “unique problems” with allowing gays and lesbians to adopt children. Claiming there is “overwhelming” evidence while not citing any studies, Sprigg said, “I think it’s legitimate to disfavor them or to exclude them altogether.”","If applicable, rewrite the article to include detailed scientific explanations or insights related to the topic.","Y.) is actively championing the cause.

"The Senate worked late into the night Friday and early Saturday, but still failed to agree on extending government surveillance programs under the USA Patriot Act before the Memorial Day holiday.Lawmakers blocked votes on both a House-passed bill and a short-term extension of the Patriot Act provisions that allow government surveillance programs.Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says lawmakers will try again on May 31, the day before the provisions expire.The Senate first took up the House bill, which would end the National Security Agency's bulk collection of domestic phone records. That bill, passed overwhelmingly by the House and supported by the Obama administration, required a 60-vote majority to proceed. It fell three votes short.The Senate then failed to advance a two-month extension of the expiring Patriot Act provision that would extend the NSA phone records program. That vote was seven short of the required 69 votes, reports NPR Washington desk senior editor Shirley Henry.Sen. Majority Leader McConnell tried to secure unanimous consent agreements on a number of measures aimed at preventing the program from lapsing on June 1, when the Patriot Act provision expires, Henry reports.McConnell first proposed a measure to extend the act to June 8. But Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican presidential contender, objected, saying he wants two amendments debated and voted on.""Our forefathers would be aghast,"" Paul said.Henry reports that McConnell then tried for an extension to June 5, but there was an objection. His proposal for June 3 met another objection; then Paul objected to a June 2 extension, Henry says.Unable to get agreement on any extension, McConnell said the Senate will come back at 4 p.m. on May 31 to try again, beginning with a vote on the House bill. That gives lawmakers only a few hours to prevent the Patriot Act provisions from expiring.The majority leader stressed that it's a dangerous time to allow the law to expire, given the threats overseas and attempted attacks here, and urged the Senate to act ""responsibly"" to protect the country, Henry reports.The Justice Department has said the NSA would begin winding down collection of domestic phone records this week if the Senate failed to act, according to the Associated Press.","Reframe the article as a manifesto, outlining a revolutionary vision or call to action based on the content.","It is a matter of grave concern that the Senate, despite working tirelessly through the night, has yet to reach a consensus on its extension.The urgency of the situation demands immediate action.

"WASHINGTON -- Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy (D) will sign an executive order on Monday barring state-funded travel to Indiana because of the state's new law that could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers for religious reasons.Malloy's move would make Connecticut the first state to boycott Indiana over its Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which Gov. Mike Pence (R) quietly signed into law last week. The law allows businesses in the state to cite religious beliefs as a legal defense. Opponents fear it offers legal protection for businesses to refuse service to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.Two cities, San Francisco and Seattle, have imposed similar bans in response to the law. Businesses have also retaliated. Angie's List is pulling a campus expansion project in Indianapolis, and the CEO of Salesforce, a $4 billion software corporation, announced plans to ""dramatically reduce our investment"" in the state because of the law.Twenty states have RFRA laws, but Indiana's law is substantially different. While other state RFRAs apply to disputes between a person and a government, Indiana's law goes further and applies to disputes between private citizens. That means, for example, a business owner could use the law to justify discrimination against customers who might otherwise be protected under law.The Indiana law could result in ""employers, landlords, small business owners, or corporations, taking the law into their own hands and acting in ways that violate generally applicable laws on the grounds that they have a religious justification for doing so,"" reads their letter. ""Members of the public will then be asked to bear the cost of their employer's, their landlord's, their local shopkeeper's, or a police officer's private religious beliefs.""That's in sharp contrast to states like Connecticut, which has an RFRA but one that pertains only to religious institutions, not private establishments. And unlike some other states, Connecticut also doesn't permit discrimination based on sexual orientation in any private establishment or institution.Before signing the order, he called the Indiana law ""disturbing and outright discriminatory,"" and said the National Collegiate Athletic Association should relocate its Final Four tournament from Indiana to another state. Those games are set to begin later this week.""I think that would be a wise choice for them to do if that's possible,"" said Malloy. ""I'll leave it up to them to make those decisions.""The NCAA president Mark Emmert has said he is ""surprised and disappointed"" by Indiana's law, and that he is waiting for some kind of clarification to the law, or an outright repeal, before deciding whether to keep holding sporting events in the state.Malloy said his executive order allows for any of the state's current contractual obligations with Indiana to play out, but said he doesn't plan to enter into any new ones.""Somebody's got to stand up to this kind of bigotry and I'm prepared to do it,"" he said.","Compose as a series of motivational posters, each highlighting a key message or quote.","****Poster 1:****Quote:** ""Discrimination is a poison that eats away at the very core of human society."" - Martin Luther King Jr.**Message:** Stand against discrimination and promote equality for all.**Poster 2:****Quote:** ""The power of imagination is boundless."" - William Shakespeare**Message:** Let your imagination guide you to a world where everyone is treated with respect.**Poster 3:****"
"Donald Trump is surging in new battleground and national polls at a time when Hillary Clinton faces tough questions not only about her health but her sweeping criticism of her Republican opponent’s supporters.Several surveys appear to show the Republican presidential nominee effectively ending, at least for now, a post-convention slump that saw Clinton leading in virtually every swing state. Now, a Monmouth University Poll shows Trump taking a narrow 2-point lead in Nevada; a Bloomberg Politics poll shows Trump leading Clinton by 5 points in Ohio; and new CNN/ORC polls show Trump leading in Florida and Ohio.In the latter survey, Trump leads 46-41 percent among likely voters in Ohio, and 47-44 percent among likely voters in Florida.“We’ve really had a good month,” Trump told Fox News’ “Fox & Friends,” claiming he’s enjoying renewed “enthusiasm” from voters.Clinton, though, plans to return to the campaign trail Thursday afternoon after taking three days off to recover from a bout of pneumonia. While her campaign dispatched high-powered surrogates to the stump in her absence -- including Bill Clinton and President Obama -- the Democratic nominee’s presence could help reset the race once again.The contest remains tight, and the polls are hardly uniform. A Quinnipiac University national poll released Wednesday showed Clinton leading 48-43 percent among likely voters.But that still represents a narrowing of the race since a late-August survey showing Clinton up 10 points.The recent surveys come as Clinton grapples with new controversies on two fronts: Her comment at a Friday fundraiser that half of Trump’s backers are in a “basket of deplorables,” and her campaign’s handling of a health scare on Sunday during a 15th anniversary ceremony honoring victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.Clinton has since expressed regret for her “deplorables” comment, though Trump has called on her to outright retract it. And Clinton’s campaign has sought to answer questions about the former secretary of state's health, after Clinton was seen stumbling at the 9/11 memorial event in New York City.The campaign said she was overheated and dehydrated, and revealed she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. While the incident revived long-simmering questions about her health, the campaign on Wednesday released additional medical details. Dr. Lisa Bardack, Clinton’s physician, said she is “recovering well with antibiotics and rest.”Bardack also said Clinton remains “healthy and fit to serve.”Trump, too, has tried to answer questions about his own health. He discussed the results of a recent physical with TV’s “Dr. Oz,” and told Fox News on Thursday “they were good.” The discussion with “Dr. Oz” will air on his show Thursday.Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign maintains they always knew states like Ohio would be competitive – and they are building out their operation there.The campaign announced that they will open a half-dozen new offices in the state, bringing their total to 54.","Reframe the text as an escape room scenario, with puzzles and challenges based on the story.","You are a secret agent in a political escape room.

"The 11 service members who were onboard a Black Hawk helicopter that crashed Tuesday night on the Florida panhandle coastline are presumed dead, a Pentagon official said, but a search-and-rescue operation was still underway Wednesday in a desperate search for survivors.Seven Marines and four soldiers were onboard a UH-60 helicopter as part of a training exercise when the chopper ran into heavy fog. Human remains and helicopter parts were recovered earlier Wednesday.""It's a tough day,"" Maj. Gen. Glenn H. Curtis, the adjutant general of the Louisiana National Guard, where the unit was based. ""They're under my command. I take very seriously their safety and well-being, and that of their families.""Kim Urr, 62, who works at the nearby Navarre Beach campground, said she heard a strange sound, followed by two explosions around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday.""It sounded like something metal either being hit or falling over, that's what it sounded like. And there were two booms afterward, similar to what you hear with ordnance booms, but more muffled,"" Urr said.President Obama spoke with the military leaders involved and expressed his condolences to the families before saying he's confident of a detailed and thorough investigation, said his spokesman, Josh Earnest.""Our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families as the search and rescue continues,"" Defense Secretary Ash Carter said on Capitol Hill.The Black Hawk crashed as Marines and National Guardsmen practiced ""insertion and extraction missions,"" using small boats and helicopters to get troops into and out of a target site, said Capt. Barry Morris, spokesman for the Marine Corps Special Operations Command at Camp Lejeune.Like the Army's Green Berets and the Navy's SEALs, these Marines were highly skilled unconventional warriors, trained to endure grueling conditions and sensitive assignments on land and at sea, from seizing ships to special reconnaissance missions and direct action inside hostile territory.The helicopter was part of a nighttime training mission Tuesday at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. There was dense fog in the area at the time of the crash but officials have not said what caused the helicopter to go down.Fog had reduced visibility to less than two miles at the time, according to the National Weather Service. Another helicopter participating in the exercise turned back because of the bad weather before the other Black Hawk crashed, authorities said.Despite the human remains washing ashore, the military still called it a rescue mission Wednesday, said Sara Vidoni, a spokeswoman for Eglin Air Force Base, outside Pensacola.The fog remained so heavy Wednesday that search boats just offshore could be heard but not seen, blasting horns as their crews peered into the choppy water. It finally began to lift in the afternoon, enabling a helicopter to slowly survey the water.About a dozen airmen wearing fatigues walked shoulder-to-shoulder down the beach, scanning the sand, while civilian rescue crews and searchers with dogs joined the effort.The Coast Guard said debris was first spotted about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, and that the search area expanded to a 17-mile stretch of the narrow sound separating Santa Rosa Island from the Florida Panhandle mainland.The Marines were part of a special operations group based in Camp Lejeune. They had arrived Sunday for a week of training.None were immediately identified, so that families could be told first.The helicopter that crashed had joined the training from an airport in nearby Destin. The site includes 20 miles of pristine beachfront under military control since before World War II — an ideal place for special operations units from across the military to practice, test range manager Glenn Barndollar told The AP last year.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",Describe the events as if they were part of a historical epic tale.,"The once serene landscape below the helicopter was marred by the echoes of its demise, a testament to the bravery and sacrifice of the eleven service members who perished in the crash.The fateful day began with a training exercise, a testament to the skill and determination of the"
"Not all the claims in the vice presidential debate stand up to scrutiny. A look at some of them and how they compare with the facts:REPUBLICAN MIKE PENCE: ""The fact that under this past administration, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious.... Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same.""THE FACTS: As a share of the total U.S. economy, the national debt has gone up 35 percent; not a doubling.Still, the debt has ballooned to $19.6 trillion. This largely reflected efforts by the Obama administration to stop the Great Recession.Would Clinton similarly increase the debt? Not according to an analysis by the independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.The Clinton plan with its tax increases would increase the gross debt -- both privately and publicly held-- by $450 billion over 10 years. Mind you, that is on top of an $8.8 trillion increase already projected by the government under current law.As for Donald Trump, the committee says his tax-cut-heavy plan would increase the gross debt by $4.3 trillion --nearly 10 times more than Clinton's plan would do.DEMOCRAT TIM KAINE, on fighting the Islamic State: ""Donald Trump doesn't have a plan.""THE FACTS: Clinton also doesn't have a plan that is materially different than what President Barack Obama is already doing.She's described a three-part strategy that involves crushing IS ""on its home turf"" in the Middle East, disrupting its infrastructure on the ground and online, and protecting America and its allies. All are current elements of the Obama administration's strategy, so it's not clear what would change or if she would accelerate any portions of it.It's also the case that Trump has not laid out a clear plan.PENCE, calling Clinton the ""architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy,"" says the crisis in Syria was the result of a ""failed and weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead.""THE FACTS: Clinton, as secretary of state, actually pushed for increased U.S. intervention after Syrian President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons against rebels. But Obama is the commander in chief and nothing has swayed him thus far. Whatever her failings might be on foreign policy, it's a stretch to accuse her of helping to lead a weak policy on Syria.PENCE: ""We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal.""THE FACTS: The coal industry's woes don't come solely from onerous federal regulations. Pence omitted the effects of steep competition from cheap natural gas.A string of major coal companies have filed for bankruptcy in recent years, including Arch Coal, Alpha Natural Resources and Peabody Energy. Layoffs and cutbacks have spread economic suffering through coal country in the Appalachians and Wyoming's Powder River Basin. By contrast, these are boom times for natural gas extraction, mostly due to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.Still, the Obama administration has implemented rules that aren't making the coal industry's life any easier. Obama last year imposed a rule requiring coal-fired power plants to cut their carbon emissions as part of his effort to combat climate change. The rule has been suspended pending a legal challenge. Obama also has halted new coal leases on federal lands until it completes a comprehensive review.PENCE, saying he's proud that ""the state of Indiana has balanced budgets.""THE FACTS: True, but that's not exactly to his credit as governor of Indiana. A balanced budget is required by law, as it is in every state except Vermont.","Rewrite the text as a patent application, proposing an invention or process inspired by the story.","The system utilizes factual data and analysis to provide accurate information and counter misleading statements made during political debates and public discourse.**Description:**The system comprises a database of factual information, a data mining module, and a claim evaluation module.

"Ben Carson has seized the national lead from Donald Trump in a new poll, in a development sure to force the billionaire businessman to modify his well-polished campaign stump boast that he's ""leading every poll.""Released ahead of Wednesday's third Republican presidential primary debate, the CBS News/New York Times Poll showed Carson leading nationally with 26 percent, to Trump's 22 percent.The survey follows a string of Iowa polls that showed the retired neurosurgeon pulling ahead in the first-in-the-nation caucus state. Trump, who had led the field nationally and in key states since the summer, has tried to downplay the results but on Tuesday acknowledged Carson is gaining momentum.""Ben Carson is now doing well,"" Trump said in an interview Tuesday morning on MSNBC.At the same time, Trump has made clear he plans to challenge Carson at Wednesday's primary debate as the two battle for the top spot.Trump previously called Carson ""low energy"" and questioned his immigration stance. On Tuesday, he predicted Carson would have to deal with more scrutiny from all directions.""One thing I know about a frontrunner, you get analyzed 15 different ways from China. A lot of things will come out,"" he said.He continued to tout his own numbers and support.""I have tremendous crowds and tremendous love in the room and, you know, we seem to have hit a chord.

It showed Carson leading Trump by 14 points, his biggest lead to date.Trump has led the Republican field nationally in almost every poll until now.The CBS News/New York Times survey showed the rest of the candidates trailing in single digits. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was in third with 8 percent, followed by former Florida Gov.

"Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon said he will vote to support the Iran nuclear deal, a pledge that puts President Barack Obama only three votes short of protecting the pact in Congress.Merkley issued a statement Sunday calling the accord “the best available strategy to block Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.”Merkley’s support brings to 31 the number of senators publicly favoring the deal, which would ease economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on the country’s nuclear program.Barring defections, Obama needs three more votes from 13 Senate Democrats who have yet to declare their position, to sustain a likely veto of legislation aimed at killing the pact.If Obama can assemble 41 Senate votes by getting most of the remaining Democrats on board, the Senate may not vote on the agreement at all.The Republican-controlled Congress has until Sept. 17 to pass a resolution disapproving the deal reached in July between six world powers and Iran. Obama has pledged to veto that resolution if it gets to his desk.While Republicans have been united in opposing the deal, only two Democratic senators -- Charles Schumer of New York, the third-ranking Democrat in the chamber, and Robert Menendez of New Jersey -- have joined them so far.Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, plans to announce his decision on Tuesday. Among other Democrats yet to disclose a position are Maryland’s Ben Cardin and New Jersey’s Cory Booker.The only uncertain Senate Republican vote is that of Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who remains undecided and is expected to make her decision after Sept. 7.Merkley, in a statement on his website, pledged to vote for the deal even while pointing to “significant shortcomings” that he said the U.S. must address with “a massive intelligence program” and monitoring.Merkley said he was troubled that the deal allows Iran to import conventional arms after five years and ballistic missile technology after eight years, and sets no restrictions on how Iran can use money it reclaims when sanctions are lifted.But he rejected a proposal from deal opponents to try to renegotiate the accord for better terms.If the U.S. rejects the deal and Iran resumes its nuclear program, “the United States would be viewed by the international community as undermining a strong framework for peacefully blocking a potential Iranian bomb,” Merkley said.While the Republican-controlled House has enough votes to pass a resolution rejecting the deal, it’s unclear whether the Senate does. Assuming all 54 Senate Republicans oppose the accord, they would need support from six Democrats to get the 60 votes necessary to advance a resolution.","Reimagine the article as a speculative fiction story, incorporating futuristic elements or technology.","The futuristic Senate chamber hummed with the anticipation of a pivotal vote.

"Jindal, a Republican who is considering a presidential run, suggested that politicians like President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton changed their views on gay marriage because of polling indicating more Americans in support of gay marriage.""I'm not one of those politicians,"" Jindal said on CNN's ""New Day."" ""My faith teaches me that marriage is between a man and a woman. I don't believe in discrimination against anybody. I'm not for changing the definition of marriage.""Jindal may be in the minority on the issue when it comes to the issue, but that won't be the case if he joins a crowded Republican primary expected to be full of same-sex opponents, like former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.Huckabee, a staunch social conservative who sought the GOP nomination in 2008, said Monday on CNN suggested he doesn't think he'll be on the ""wrong side of history"" when it comes to same-sex marriage. ""When you say 'the wrong side of history,' let's just be reminded that there's been a relatively, and I mean a very relative brief history of same-sex marriage. The overwhelming history is the natural law of marriage, biblical marriage,"" he said. ""So I don't think there's a side of history that's overwhelming at this point. People have their opinions."" But Huckabee, who's insisted social issues won't be the linchpin of his probable candidacy, argued that the presidential race will be focused on the economy and proposals to combat poverty. Jindal's comments came as he sounded off on the battle over same-sex marriage brewing in neighboring Alabama, where officials in dozens of counties refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples on Monday, the first day in the state's history same-sex couples have been allowed to wed after a federal court ruling overturned the state's ban. Same-sex couples wed in Alabama despite efforts to block them Jindal sidestepped questions about whether county officials should respect the federal ruling and lawfully issue same-sex marriage licenses. Instead, the governor said he hopes the Supreme Court will rule to uphold state's legislative bans on gay marriage when the court rules on the issue by this summer. Louisiana's legislature overwhelmingly amended the state's constitution in 2004 to define marriage solely as the union of a man and a woman. But if the Supreme Court overturns same-sex marriage bans around the country — which it may very likely do — Jindal said the U.S. Congress should pass a constitutional amendment upholding state's same-sex marriage bans, an all-but-impossible endeavor requiring two-thirds support in the House and Senate.","Reframe the text as a pilot's log, navigating through the events or ideas as if on a journey.","My journey began today in the heart of the debate surrounding the controversial issue of same-sex marriage.

"U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday’s unity march against terrorism.Kerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.The visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.The French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday’s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.Among roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.Kerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi’s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.In a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as “quibbling a little bit.” He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.“But that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,” he said.“And I don’t think the people of France have any doubts about America’s understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.”","Develop as an email newsletter to clients, highlighting key points and implications.","S.

"Administrators at the popular online forum Reddit have been accused of censorship after quarantining a subreddit titled 'european.'Subreddits, which are also known as communities, are forums dedicated to specific topics.“The administration has decided to censor free speech for Europeans and they quarantined the subreddit on the 12th of May 2016,” says a note on the subreddit link. With the subreddit set to private, the note adds that “You must be a moderator or approved submitter to visit.” Visitors to the subreddit were also urged to continue their discussions on Voat, another online forum.The question of bias in social media has erupted recently. The Reddit accusation came just days after anonymous allegations that contractors at Facebook deliberately suppressed conservative news on the site’s Trending Topics section. Facebook has denied any political bias, saying there is “no evidence” of the alleged activity.Reddit told FoxNews.com that the 'european' subreddit violated the forum's content policy. ""Quarantines on Reddit are rare - there are thousands of vibrant conversations flourishing on the site every day,"" it explained, in an emailed statement. ""Subreddits are quarantined only when the content is clearly offensive to the broader Reddit community.""Quarantining aims to prevent the content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not wish to do so.""A subreddit is quarantined when there are concerns that its content is extreme and could be offensive to people outside of that community,"" explained Reddit. ""The quarantine process doesn’t end the conversation; it adds an opt-in measure so that people have the choice to join the conversation,"" it added.Restrictions on a quarantined subreddit include requiring an explicit opt-in, requiring an account with a verified email address, no use of custom images and the removal of revenue generation.Related: Reddit updates content policy, bans a 'handful' of groups that exist 'solely to annoy' othersThe ‘european’ quarantining prompted a mixed reaction elsewhere on Reddit. Some users say that racist views were expressed on the subreddit, while others say that it hosted a range of opinions and cite the importance of open dialogue.Reddit, which had over 277 million unique visitors last month, uses teams of volunteers to moderate subreddits.The forum updated its content policy last year, consolidating multiple rules and policies into a single set of guidelines.A blogger with an interest in numbers, who uses the name Curious Gnu, recently crunched a Reddit dataset of 4.6 million comments and noted that 78 percent of Reddit threads with over 1,000 comments mention Nazis or Hitler. The blogger found that around 2.6 percent of comments in the ‘european’ subreddit mentioned Nazis or Hitler. A slightly higher percentage of comments on the ‘AskHistorians’ subreddit mentioned Nazis or Hitler, with around 2.75 percent of comments on the ‘history’ subreddit referencing the topics.Related: No censorship in Chinese Internet, says China's top censorReddit prohibits illegal content, spam, publication of someone’s private and confidential information, sexually suggestive content featuring minors and anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people.

"Say what you will about Donald Trump, but the man is winner. Trump didn’t just wallop his opponents Tuesday — he crushed them. Up 41 percent in Delaware, 40 percent in Rhode Island, 37 percent in Pennsylvania, 33 percent in Maryland, 30 percent in Connecticut, he’s estimated to have won 110 delegates, versus five for Kasich and three for Cruz.If the race for the GOP nomination were a Little League game, the mercy rule would be imposed.Here’s where we stand today. Ted Cruz is mathematically eliminated from winning the Republican nomination before the convention in Cleveland. John Kasich has now won a single state — Ohio — where he is governor. If ever there were a series of states that would at least theoretically be fertile territory for him, it would be the Northeast, home of the last vestiges of Republican moderates. Yet, he didn’t crack 30 percent anywhere. Republicans can talk all they want about Never Trump and trying to stop him at the RNC in Cleveland. They can talk about changing the rules and holding out hope that a white knight candidate will emerge. It isn’t going to happen. Either Trump is the nominee or he’ll burn the whole thing to the ground. If you’re a gambler, go all in on the former.It is worth stepping back, however, and noting that Trump’s hammerlock over the party — and his ascendancy within the GOP — is astounding. He’s a political amateur who never held elected office; he’s a xenophobe, a bully, and a misogynist and he has run directly against the leadership of the party he hopes to lead. Yet, today he stands on the cusp of winning the nomination of the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Nixon, and Reagan. I know we’ve all become inured to Trump’s insults, his know-nothingness, and his crudeness, but it can’t be said enough — truly we are living in a political moment unlike anything that any of us has seen before.Here’s what might be even more amazing: Trump’s position as the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party is not the most remarkable political event this year. Rather, it’s that the Democratic Party is poised to nominate the first woman to be a major party candidate for president. Somehow this constantly seems to be forgotten; and whether you like Hillary Clinton or despise her, that America is poised to nominate a woman for president is a big deal.Tuesday night, Clinton racked up four more primary wins, including the delegate-rich states of Maryland and Pennsylvania. Only in Rhode Island did Bernie Sanders thwart her. Early on in the evening, before all the races had been called, he gave a “victory” speech in West Virginia that not only left unmentioned the evening’s results, but plowed forward with confidence about the road ahead. It’s a fitting metaphor for the Sanders campaign, which increasingly seems to operate in a realm completely divorced from reality. Sanders cannot and will not win the Democratic nomination. Period.Indeed, in her victory speech, Clinton — as she has increasingly done — simply ignored Sanders. Instead she aimed her daggers at her real target, Donald Trump. The Democratic race will continue, but for all intents and purposes, it is over. Clinton can now begin her pivot to the general election, and Sanders can play out the string.What we now with some certainty is that we’re only a few months away from an historic, unprecedented presidential campaign — and no matter which candidate wins on Election Day, history will be made.","Transform the article into a series of blog posts, diving deeper into different aspects of the story.","****Trump's Hammerlock and the Republican Nomination**Donald Trump's victory in Tuesday's primary elections has cemented his position as the presumptive Republican nominee.

"Cruz’s remarks came soon after House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) decided to bring up a “clean” bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, backing down from the effort to use department funding to strip authority for Obama’s executive actions.""Since December, the outcome has been baked in the cake. It was abundantly clear to anyone watching that leadership in both houses intended to capitulate on the fight against amnesty,"" Cruz said, adding, ""It was a strategy doomed to failure. It’s an old adage in Washington: Never take a hostage you’re not prepared to shoot.""Cruz's comments referred to the decision made in December 2014 to stall funding only for DHS, which made that agency the GOP's major source of leverage in the immigration battle. The Texas Republican pointed out that he earned the ""animosity and ire"" of his colleagues at that time because he supported threatening to shut down government agencies.""There was no chance, zero, that Republicans were going to fail to fund the Department of Homeland Security because Republicans care deeply about homeland security,"" Cruz continued.But Cruz failed to note that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had vowed to prevent all federal agencies, not just DHS, from shutting down. The shutdown strategy was doomed by the fact that the Senate has too few Republicans to overcome opposition from Democrats, who are against the method of using government funding to target White House policies. As a result, McConnell and Boehner had few practical options to achieve Cruz's objective of standing up to Obama through a shutdown.Still, Cruz implied the leaders did not try very hard, saying they should at least have chosen a better hostage.""If we had been serious about this fight, and we should have been, the continuing resolution [under which DHS funding expired in February 2015] should have focused on the EPA, or the IRS or the Department of Labor,"" Cruz said. ""Now, those are departments which a majority would be prepared to allow funding to temporarily expire in order to use as leverage.""When a reporter pointed out that Cruz himself did not take advantage of an opportunity in last week's battle to delay funding a little longer, the senator defended himself, saying: ""I have fought against executive amnesty at every stage using every tool that is available. Leadership has made the decision to capitulate.""""We see a pattern over and over again. When Republicans are running for office, they tell their constituents they will be conservative, they will honor and defend the Constitution, they will follow through on the principles their constituents are trusting them to follow through upon,"" Cruz said.

"The White House and Republican leaders in Congress face long odds in trying to revive trade legislation after a telling defeat engineered by President Barack Obama's fellow Democrats.Obama's ambitious trade agenda is in serious doubt, as is his quest for a capstone second-term achievement.Without the power to negotiate trade deals that Congress can approve or reject, but not amend, Obama has little chance of securing the Pacific Rim pact that his administration has worked toward for years.Friday's rebuff highlighted the strained relations between Obama and congressional Democrats, who voted down a worker assistance program crucial to the negotiating authority measure just hours after the president implored them not to.Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, had worked in rare tandem on this issue, yet their inability to deliver raises the question of whether much else will get done with Republicans running Congress and Obama in the White House for the next 18 months.""This isn't over yet,"" Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., a main supporter of the trade legislation. ""I'm hopeful that the Democrats understand the consequences and get together with the president and finish this as soon as possible.""House GOP leaders took steps that would allow another vote on the worker retraining program in coming days, but that would require at least 90 votes to shift.Republicans sounded pessimistic that they could add many more votes for a program that most on their side deride as wasteful and unnecessary.House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California and her labor-backed allies are determined to oppose the Trade Adjustment Assistance program as a way to collapse the entire package. So it seems unlikely that enough Democratic votes would emerge to save the program, even though the party has promoted it for years.""Some of my Democratic colleagues are in danger of self-immolation"" on the workers' program and ""I think that's sad,"" said Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., one of the few Democrats who backed Obama on Friday's votes.Another possible route is to send revised legislation back to the Senate. But senators approved the larger package only narrowly last month after intense battles, and the White House desperately wants to avoid giving opponents there another chance to strangle the legislation.White House press secretary Josh Earnest dismissed Friday's outcome as an ""entanglement"" and ""procedural snafu.""But it was more than a ""snafu"" that caused Pelosi and the majority of House Democrats to revolt against their president.The White House, congressional Republicans and business groups argued that the special negotiating power is a necessary tool for trade deals opening up crucial markets to American goods.Union-backed House Democrats never bought the argument. They felt burned by promises from past administrations about trade deals they blame for job and manufacturing losses in their districts.Trade bills have always had a tough road in Congress. After election losses in recent years the House Democratic caucus is smaller and more liberal, attuned to economic issues in the wake of the financial sector meltdown and recession.Against that backdrop Obama was not able to bring enough House Democrats his way.

"Donald Trump easily won the Washington state primary on Tuesday, but his victory was overshadowed by violence outside a rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where protesters smashed windows and threw rocks at police.With 73% of votes counted in Washington, Trump had won 76.2% of primary voters. John Kasich and Ted Cruz, both of whom have dropped out of the race, had won 9.9.% and 10.1% respectively.Trump’s victory leaves him only needing a few dozen more delegates to reach the magic number of 1,237 required to cement the Republican nomination.Outside Trump’s rally in Albuquerque, protests against the presumptive nominee turned nasty on Tuesday night, with protesters overturning crowd control barriers and throwing rocks at police.There were early posts on social media reporting gunshots and tear gas, but the Albuquerque police department said those were inaccurate. Nonetheless, police horses were deployed to control the large crowd of protesters, and some reports showed pepper spray being used. The door to the convention center where Trump was speaking was also smashed.More than an hour after Trump had finished speaking and left for California, where he will campaign for the next few days in the run-up to the state’s 7 June primary, hundreds of protesters still thronged the streets, waving Mexican flags, lighting fires and chanting.Trump is the only remaining candidate campaigning for the Republican nomination, but Kasich and Cruz were also on the ballot in Washington, having suspended their campaigns after the ballots were printed.Dr Ben Carson was also on the ballot because he reportedly never officially submitted a withdrawal of his candidacy to the state.The state delegation, which was selected on Saturday at the state convention in preparation for the primary, is composed almost entirely of supporters of Cruz, whose supporters overwhelmed the state convention in Pasco.Despite this, the delegates are bound by state party rules to vote for Trump on the first ballot at the national convention, US senate candidate and former chairman of the Washington state Republican party Chris Vance, who was at the convention, told the Guardian.However, with seven upcoming primaries, including New Jersey and California, Trump is expected to easily overtake the delegate mark needed to win the nomination on the first ballot at the convention in Cleveland in July, avoiding a contested convention.In a strange quirk of party politics, the Democrats also held a presidential primary in Washington on Tuesday, but it didn’t matter in the slightest because the Democratic delegation from Washington was already settled by a caucus in March, at which Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton 73% to 27%.Interestingly, in the Democratic primary – which was admittedly meaningless as it has no bearing on the number of delegates as opposed to the caucuses – Clinton won comfortably, 53.63% to 46.37%, implying that perhaps Democratic voters want the primary season to be, finally, over with.","Reframe the article as a personal narrative, sharing a personal connection or reflection on the events.","Trump's victory was overshadowed by the violence that erupted outside his rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a stark reminder of the volatile political climate that our nation finds itself in.As I watched the news unfold, I felt a mix of emotions.

"Many Republicans claim that President Obama is among the most polarizing presidents in modern history. If the results of a new Gallup survey measuring his approval rating are any indication, they might be right.The president's overall approval rating for his just finished sixth year in office stood at 42.6 percent, according to Gallup. That's well below Bill Clinton's or Ronald Reagan's sixth-year average (63.8 percent and 59.9 percent, respectively). Even so, Obama's average for the year is still ahead of Richard Nixon (25.4 percent), who was by this point in his presidency mired in Watergate; George W. Bush (37.3 percent); or Harry S. Truman (38.6 percent).But another measure that looks at how Republicans and Democrats view presidential performance shows that Obama is on track to be the most polarizing president ever, nudging out his predecessor with an average 70-point gap between the political parties.""Both Bush and Obama were elected with hopes of unifying the country. However, the opposite has happened, at least in the way Americans view the job the president is doing, with presidential evaluations more divided along party lines than ever before, Gallup notes.""These increasingly partisan views of presidents may have as much to do with the environment in which these presidents have governed as with their policies, given 24-hour news coverage of what they do and increasingly partisan news and opinion sources on television, in print and online,"" the polling organization says.In his sixth year in office, 79 percent of Democrats approve of Obama's performance, while just 9 percent of Republicans do. George W. Bush's numbers were exactly reversed in year six of his presidency (79 percent of Republicans approval vs. 9 percent for Democrats).Obama and Bush had their most polarized approval ratings in their fourth years in office, both with a 76 percentage point gap between Republicans and Democrats for the final year of their first term (although Bush had slightly higher approval from both parties, the gap was still the same). As Gallup points out, the fourth year is typically the most polarized in a president's due to it being an election year.According to Gallup: ""Each of Obama's six years in office rank among the 10 most polarized in the last 60 years, with George W. Bush holding the other four spots. Bush's most polarized years were his fourth through seventh years in office, after the rally in support for him following the 9/11 terror attacks had faded. Clearly, political polarization has reached new heights in recent years, under a Republican and a Democratic president.""","Convert the article into a script for a short play or skit, highlighting key dialogues and interactions.",****Characters:*** President Obama* George W.

"State officials announced major water cutbacks for Northern California farmers Friday, a historic step that could challenge claims the agriculture industry is getting a free pass during the state's epic drought.The cutbacks will affect some of California's oldest water rights holders — farmers who laid claim to surface water more than a century ago — for the first time in four decades. They will not be allowed to draw water from the San Joaquin River, the Sacramento River and the delta that forms where the two rivers meet. State officials said the rivers simply don't have enough water to meet the demands of all rights holders.This isn't the first time during the current drought that state has cut off supplies to surface water users, including farmers. The water board has already ""curtailed"" nearly 9,000 water rights this year, all of them ""junior"" water rights that were established post-1914.But for the first time since a severe drought in the late 1970s, California is starting to tell ""senior"" water rights holders, who laid claim to surface water before 1914, that there just isn't enough water for them. The cutbacks announced Friday impact rights holders who established their claims between 1903 and 1914.And more historic cuts could be coming over the summer. The State Water Resources Control Board said Friday that it's continuing to monitor conditions in watersheds across the state, and that cutbacks could be on the horizon for even more senior rights holders.""Curtailment notices for other watersheds and for more senior water right holders in these watersheds may be imminent,"" the water board said in a statement.State officials said in a conference call that the water rights being curtailed comprise 1.2 million acre-feet, but it's unclear whether the cutbacks will save quite that much. The water board has indicated in recent months that curtailments for senior rights holders were coming, leading some farmers to store extra water in preparation.Sammy Roth writes about energy and water for The Desert Sun.

"LAS VEGAS  The Democratic presidential candidates are holding their first debate Tuesday night in Las Vegas.It marks the first time frontrunner Hillary Clinton and her main challenger so far  socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.  will appear on the same stage in this campaign, along with the other three candidates.This campaign was expected to be a cakewalk for the former first lady, but it hasn't turned out that way.One big reason seems to be the story that just won't away: how she used a private email server to conduct government business. It's fed a perception that she can play by a different set of rules.Even so, Clinton still has a decent lead nationally over the socialist senator from Vermont, but Sanders is coming on strong. He's beating her comfortably in the key state of New Hampshire and is close in Iowa, too.Plus, Sanders is the one drawing tens of thousands of people to his events. Democratic voters seem to be listening intently to his populist messages.With the threat from Sanders a reality, Clinton is now trying to reposition herself a little more leftward. Just recently she came out against President Barack Obama's big Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement.That's a reversal because while serving as secretary of state, she was for it. This new position puts her more in line with the liberal base of her party.""As of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it,"" Clinton said. ""I don't believe it's going to meet the high bar I have set.""So, tonight the drama will center on how much Sen. Sanders and the other Democrats confront Clinton directly on the debate stage.Expect former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley to be an instigator. He's trying to get traction and has taken some shots at Clinton over the last few months.As for Clinton herself, she's trying to avoid a repeat of 2008 when she went in as the heavy favorite, then ran into a buzz saw called Barack Obama.This time around the buzz is growing for Bernie Sanders.","Convert the article into a crossword puzzle, with clues derived from the content and themes.",**Crossword Puzzle:****Across:**1.

"After the Paris attacks, Americans are divided on Obama’s plan to let in 10,000 Syrian refugees. The timing is good: Thanksgiving can shed light on how much the nation’s tradition of hospitality should influence this decision.Syria refugee Nedal Al-Hayk works as a fabricator in Warren, Mich. Several U.S. governors are threatening to halt efforts to allow Syrian refugees into their states in the aftermath of the coordinated attacks in Paris, though an immigration expert says they have no legal authority to do so.Just as Americans prepare to express their hospitality toward others during Thanksgiving, a national debate has erupted over another kind of hospitality: President Obama’s plan to welcome 10,000 Syrian refugees into the United States. After the Paris attacks, the plan has been widely challenged, not least by nearly half the US governors. They fear Islamic State terrorists might slip in as “sleepers” among the refugees. Others argue back that the US already rigorously vets all asylum seekers – for as long as two years.Might Thanksgiving, with all its traditions and meaning, shed some light on this debate?The practice of welcoming strangers into one’s home or community long precedes the first American thanksgiving, that autumn feast of 1621 when Pilgrims and native Americans expressed gratitude for either the harvest, each other, or God’s mercy (or all of the above). Hospitality is an ancient Middle East virtue, rooted in the traditions of desert tribes and deeply encoded in the three Abrahamic religions. In the scriptural book of Hebrews, we read: “Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.”Hospitality, like Thanksgiving, is a type of giving that treats others – rich or poor, stranger or family – as equals. In ancient days, this egalitarian focus was symbolized by the washing of a guest’s feet. Today it serves as a cornerstone for democracy. It is also the basis for the United Nations Refugee Convention, in which a majority of the world’s states have agreed to grant asylum to people deemed to be refugees.In the US, a thanksgiving day was not an official holiday until Lincoln made it one during the Civil War. The woman who championed it, Sarah Hale, wrote in 1864: “Let us each see to it that on this one day there shall be no family or individual, within the compass of our means to help, who shall not have some portion prepared, and some reason to join in the general Thanksgiving.”Granting permanent asylum in the US to a refugee, of course, is not the same as sharing a turkey dinner with a stranger. Today’s modern nation-states are careful about who crosses their borders, either to prevent problems or to enhance their society. But with 1 in every 122 people now either a refugee, internally displaced, or seeking asylum, the need for hospitality is great. And in hospitality a nation can find its greatness.","Convert the article into a crossword puzzle, with clues derived from the content and themes.",**Crossword Puzzle:****Across:**1.

"WASHINGTON — House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday that Senate Democrats should ""get off their ass"" and stop blocking a $40 billion Homeland Security bill that would derail President Obama's immigration programs.Boehner's comments came a day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the Senate has reached a stalemate and ""the next move obviously is up to the House."" Senate Democrats voted three times last week to block the DHS funding bill from moving forward. They object to House-passed provisions that would cut off all funds to carry out Obama's executive orders on immigration.The two Republican leaders seem to be each placing responsibility on the other chamber for what happens next on the funding bill. Unless Congress acts, funding for the Department of Homeland Security will expire on Feb. 27 and the agency will face a partial shutdown.Boehner said the House will not take up a revised bill despite the Senate impasse.""The House has done its job,"" Boehner, R-Ohio, said at a news conference after meeting with House Republicans. ""Why don't you go ask the Senate Democrats when they're going to get off their ass and do something other than to vote 'no'?""Obama announced in November that he would protect about 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation and allow them to work legally in the U.S. His program would help the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens. It also would expand his 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which gives temporary legal status and work permits to undocumented immigrants brought to the USA as children.The House-passed bill would cut off all funding for the 2012 DACA program as well as blocking funds for Obama's latest immigration orders. Senate Democrats say they will only support the DHS funding bill if the immigration provisions are scrapped.""If Congress wants stronger border security and immigration enforcement, a clean funding bill for DHS is what we should be rallying around,"" said Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., the senior Democrat on the Senate homeland security committee. ""I hope that Congress can come together to do the right thing — support the passage of a clean, full-year appropriation for the Department of Homeland Security by Feb. 27 — and then get to work to pass a thoughtful, comprehensive immigration reform bill.""Republicans see Obama's immigration orders as an unconstitutional power grab and view the DHS funding bill as the best leverage they have to stop them. But Senate Republicans, who have a 54-vote majority, need 60 votes to advance the DHS funding bill and they have been unable to attract any Democrats to their side.Boehner and McConnell have both said they don't want a shutdown of Homeland Security, but their options are running out.There has been talk in both chambers of the possibility of passing a continuing resolution that would keep DHS open and funded at 2014 levels. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has spoken out against that option because it would not allow DHS to hire new Secret Service agents, buy new surveillance equipment for the Southwest border or send certain security grants to states and local governments.","Conceive as a children's book story, simplifying complex ideas into engaging narratives.","The story is about a bill that would fund the Department of Homeland Security and include provisions on immigration.

"""We are behind. She has some advantages,"" Kellyanne Conway said on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" adding that those advantages include that Clinton ""has a former president, happens to be her husband, campaigning for her; the current president and first lady, vice president -- all much more popular than she can hope to be. And she's seen as the incumbent.""""He delivers his own speeches. This is his candidacy. He's the guy who's running for the White House, and he has the privilege to say what he wants,"" Conway told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday.""This lifetime ban on lobbying -- if you've worked in the White House, you can't lobby for foreign nations. That's sort of the big, ethical shower we're all going to need to take post-Hillary Clinton State Department,"" she said, touting portions of Trump's speech.Trump also proposed a series of reforms that include term limits of six years for House and Senate members. That would've meant Trump running mate Mike Pence would've been term-limited out of office halfway through his 12-year tenure representing Indiana. ""He was definitely living in the swamp,"" Conway said of Pence, who led fiscal conservative fights like opposing the bank bailout pushed by his own party's President George W. Bush. ""Mike Pence would agree with Donald Trump on that: When you're there for too long, you need that fresh blood and new perspective,"" Conway said. ""I wish there were more members like Mike Pence. If there were, we wouldn't need to have the conversation."" Conway also attacked Clinton over her family foundation's acceptance of foreign contributions -- but Tapper pointed out that those details are public because the Clinton Foundation has published lists of its donors, while Trump hasn't released his tax returns. Tapper said: ""We have no idea what his ties are and where there might be moneyed interests and conflicts of interest because he won't disclose his tax returns."" Conway responded: ""Here's what we do know: We know that -- as he said yesterday in Gettysburg, Jake -- he used to be an insider. He's somebody who breathed rarefied air right up there with the Clintons and others, given his position, his power and his wealth and his great success as a businessman.

"CENTENNIAL, Colo. — Gone are the orange hair and the thousand-yard stare. In their place, trimmed hair, a shaggy beard and red-framed glasses.Sitting upright in court in a dark jacket, blue striped shirt and khaki slacks, James Holmes looking very much like the neuroscience graduate student he used to be, not a man on trial for his life.But Holmes, now 27, faces 12 murder charges in connection with the summer 2012 massacre at a suburban Denver movie theater's midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises. He could be executed if convicted. Holmes also faces dozens of other charges, including attempted murder. At least 70 were wounded in the massacre.Jury selection in the case began Tuesday afternoon, and Judge Carlos Samour said an initial pool of 9,000 jurors will be whittled down to 12, plus 12 alternates. The trial may last into October.Once opening statements get underway, cameras will be allowed in the courtroom. However, they are not allowed during jury selection.In a lengthy address to prosecutors and Holmes' defense team, Samour said he expects ""passionate and zealous"" courtroom arguments, but reminded both sides and prospective jurors that Holmes is innocent until proven guilty. The jury that will decide Holmes' guilt also will decide whether he should be executed.""What's most important to me is that justice is done,"" said Samour. ""That's what this whole process is about: Justice.""Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler wants Holmes put to death for the July 20, 2012, mass shooting in Aurora. He argues that life in prison is insufficient justice for the victims, survivors and their families.By pleading not guilty by reason of insanity, Holmes admitted he committed the shooting but claims he's legally not responsible for his actions. He's undergone at least two mental-health evaluations at the state mental hospital, but the results have remained secret.Holmes, then 24, was arrested at the scene by investigators who then discovered his apartment had been booby-trapped with explosives. His lawyers acknowledge Holmes, a former neuroscience doctorate student, was the lone shooter but say he was gripped by a psychotic episode.Legal analyst Scott Robinson said insanity-plea cases are rare, and it's even more unusual for a jury to find someone not guilty by reason of insanity.""It's a minuscule percentage ... yet the public perception is that people are getting off on the insanity plea all the time,"" said Robinson. ""It's actually a rare bird.""In December 2014 — just as jury summons went out — Holmes' parents issued a public statement begging prosecutors to drop the death penalty and give their son a plea deal that would see him locked up and treated.""We do not know how many victims of the theater shooting would like to see our son killed.

"One of two crew members survived the shooting down of a Russian warplane by Turkey on Tuesday, Russian officials say, and was rescued by a Syrian commando unit in an operation that ended early Wednesday.The news comes as international tensions continue to rise over the incident. As we reported Tuesday, Turkey says the Russian Su-24 fighter jet was in Turkish airspace when it was shot down by Turkish F-16s. Turkey says it warned the Russian warplane 10 times before taking action.Russia maintains the jet was flying over Syria at the time.Both Russian crew members appeared to eject from the jet and parachute to the ground, but one was reportedly found dead Tuesday by a Syrian rebel group.Russia now says the other crew member has been rescued. It was a costly mission for Russia, NPR's Corey Flintoff reports for our Newscast unit:""Russia's defense minister said the pilot was rescued in a 12-hour operation that ended in the early hours of the morning. ""Rebel fighters in the area claim they shot one of the Russian helicopters involved in the search yesterday and then used a missile to destroy it on the ground after it was forced to land. ""Russia says one of the helicopter crewmen was killed, but the rest were evacuated safely.""Meanwhile, Russia and Turkey continue to exchange angry rhetoric while at the same time calling for military restraint.Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Wednesday that Russia could not justify its attacks on ethnic Turks in Syria under the pretext of fighting the Islamic State, and reiterated statements by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that Turkey will continue to defend its airspace.But, Davutoglu said, targeting Russia is ""out of the question,"" Reuters reports.Also on Wednesday, Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, called the shooting of the plane a ""planned provocation"" that is prompting Moscow to ""reconsider relations with Ankara,"" The Associated Press reports. On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the shooting a ""stab in the back.""But Lavrov says Moscow has ""no intention to go to war with Turkey,"" the AP writes.Russia says it is deploying an advanced anti-aircraft system to its base in Syria. Corey says the missiles appear to be guarding against Turkish planes — or planes from other coalition members, such as the U.S. or France. ""As far as we know, ISIS and other jihadi groups in Syria have no aircraft that could threaten the Russian base,"" he reports.Moscow may be considering nonmilitary forms of retaliation against Turkey.

"The 62-38 vote to end debate on the bill, moving it toward a final vote, was a victory for Obama, who had linked with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, to push the bill despite opposition from Senate Democratic leaders.""This last vote was a major step forward on this important legislation,"" said Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Republican who sponsored the bill.The Senate is now set to vote on changes to the bill, including one that would force the Obama administration to use trade deals to crack down on countries that manipulate the value of their currencies to give their exports a price advantage in the United States — an amendment the White House opposes because it would add a huge new complication into trade negotiations.Even though Senate passage is ultimately now much more likely, the House could be tougher. There, tea party conservatives are linking up with liberals to form a broader populist opposition than what existed in the Senate.The measure would hand the President six years' worth of ""trade promotion authority"" — the power to submit trade deals to Congress for an up-or-down vote with limited debate and no amendments. It's considered crucial to finalizing the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive trade deal that serves as the economic underpinning of Obama's ""Asia pivot."" It would link 40% of the world's economy, including the United States, Japan, Australia, Canada and Mexico. The trade deal has launched an obscure commerce policy discussion into a fiery political battle that has positioned the President at odds with most of his party, particularly Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and driven a wedge between the Democratic presidential front-runner, Hillary Clinton, and her primary challengers. The Senate is also looking to dispense with the trade votes to move forward and take up bills to reform or reauthorize the Patriot Act, an issue that considers to deeply divide the Senate and Republicans on Capitol Hill. The House overwhelmingly passed the USA Freedom Act, a bipartisan bill to reform the Patriot Act and effectively end the National Security Agency's bulk collection of phone data on millions of Americans. And while that bill was the result of a compromise between reform advocates and House Republican leadership, the bill is facing tough opposition in the Senate from powerful Republicans like McConnell, though the majority leader has vowed to allow a vote on the reform measure.

"Donald Trump easily won the Washington state primary on Tuesday, but his victory was overshadowed by violence outside a rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where protesters smashed windows and threw rocks at police.With 73% of votes counted in Washington, Trump had won 76.2% of primary voters. John Kasich and Ted Cruz, both of whom have dropped out of the race, had won 9.9.% and 10.1% respectively.Trump’s victory leaves him only needing a few dozen more delegates to reach the magic number of 1,237 required to cement the Republican nomination.Outside Trump’s rally in Albuquerque, protests against the presumptive nominee turned nasty on Tuesday night, with protesters overturning crowd control barriers and throwing rocks at police.There were early posts on social media reporting gunshots and tear gas, but the Albuquerque police department said those were inaccurate. Nonetheless, police horses were deployed to control the large crowd of protesters, and some reports showed pepper spray being used. The door to the convention center where Trump was speaking was also smashed.More than an hour after Trump had finished speaking and left for California, where he will campaign for the next few days in the run-up to the state’s 7 June primary, hundreds of protesters still thronged the streets, waving Mexican flags, lighting fires and chanting.Trump is the only remaining candidate campaigning for the Republican nomination, but Kasich and Cruz were also on the ballot in Washington, having suspended their campaigns after the ballots were printed.Dr Ben Carson was also on the ballot because he reportedly never officially submitted a withdrawal of his candidacy to the state.The state delegation, which was selected on Saturday at the state convention in preparation for the primary, is composed almost entirely of supporters of Cruz, whose supporters overwhelmed the state convention in Pasco.Despite this, the delegates are bound by state party rules to vote for Trump on the first ballot at the national convention, US senate candidate and former chairman of the Washington state Republican party Chris Vance, who was at the convention, told the Guardian.However, with seven upcoming primaries, including New Jersey and California, Trump is expected to easily overtake the delegate mark needed to win the nomination on the first ballot at the convention in Cleveland in July, avoiding a contested convention.In a strange quirk of party politics, the Democrats also held a presidential primary in Washington on Tuesday, but it didn’t matter in the slightest because the Democratic delegation from Washington was already settled by a caucus in March, at which Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton 73% to 27%.Interestingly, in the Democratic primary – which was admittedly meaningless as it has no bearing on the number of delegates as opposed to the caucuses – Clinton won comfortably, 53.63% to 46.37%, implying that perhaps Democratic voters want the primary season to be, finally, over with.",Convert into a dialogue between two people with opposing views on the subject.,"""It's true that Trump won the primary, but the violence that occurred outside his rally in Albuquerque overshadowed his victory,"" countered Sarah, a political scientist.""The protesters were clearly upset with Trump's policies and his rhetoric,"" John argued.

"The Republican Party’s identity crisis keeps getting worse. Hours after House Speaker Paul Ryan said he was not ready to support Donald Trump, the presumptive G.O.P. nominee, 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney also refused to endorse his successor, saying that he was “dismayed” by the state of American politics and that he wished for “better choices” for candidates who, unfortunately, do not exist anymore.While Romney ruled out the possibility of a third-party candidacy during a Q&A at a fundraising gala Thursday night in Washington, he said he was so fundamentally disappointed with the G.O.P. that he could not support Trump in good conscience, nor would he switch allegiances and support Hillary Clinton.“I see way too much demagoguery and populism on both sides of the aisle and I only hope and aspire that we'll see more greatness,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.Earlier this year, Romney championed the Never Trump movement, attempting to block his nomination by proposing the remaining Republican candidates unite to force a contested convention in which an alternative would win the nomination despite winning fewer primaries. That dream ended earlier this week when Ted Cruz dropped out of the race (and John Kasich soon after), but that didn’t stop Romney from sticking to his convictions.“I happen to think that the person who is leading the nation has an enormous and disproportionate impact on the course of the world, so I am dismayed at where we are now,” he said. “I wish we had better choices, and I keep hoping that somehow things will get better, and I just don't see an easy answer from where we are.”Romney also praised Ryan, his former running mate, who recently took on Trump. “He is where he needs to be,” he explained, saying that he was impressed that Ryan could somehow get the wildly fractious House G.O.P. to work together. “I’d love to see him run for president, but having a Speaker of the House, at this stage, where we don’t know what’s going to happen on the presidential race, having a Speaker of the House with that kind of leadership capacity is very encouraging. I have hopes that he’ll remain Speaker.”Romney may not be the first Republican leader to publicly disavow Trump since he became the party’s nominee—that honor goes to Nebraska senator Ben Sasse, who quickly argued that an “adult” step in and run for president on a third-party ticket—but he is by far the most prominent. So far, there have been rumblings within an embarrassed G.O.P. that they could never support Trump: both George H.W. Bush and his son George W. Bush refused to endorse or comment on the nomination, and do not plan on attending the Republican National Convention. Senator John McCain was recorded saying that Trump would severely hurt his re-election chances in Arizona, a Latino-heavy state that borders Mexico. And, as Hillary Clinton highlighted in an e-mail blast, that sentiment isn’t limited to high-profile Republicans, either: dozens of other G.O.P. congressional representatives, governors, and major political figures are all quickly boarding the anti-Trump train—or, at the very least, refusing to comment.",Convert into a dialogue between two people with opposing views on the subject.,"**Person 1:** (optimistic)""The Republican Party is going to be strong under Trump's leadership.

"The water crisis in Flint, Mich., is just the tip of the iceberg – and if you think that it can’t happen in your community, you’re sadly mistaken. The aging water infrastructure in this country is deeply flawed. Many of the 150,000 public water systems that serve more than 300 million people are based on rusting, leaky pipes and decades-old plans that— if not corrected and replaced— will have devastating and long-lasting effects on our communities.The disaster in Flint, which began in 2014 when the city switched its water supply from Detroit’s system to the Flint River in a cost-saving measure, is likely brewing in many other communities. It is inconceivable to me that in the most developed nation on the planet, we have exposed families and young children to the poisonous effects of lead. And it is almost criminal to me that water supply officials were unaware that the water pumping through a large American city was endangering the community. That level of negligence is beyond comprehension.The dangerous, detrimental effects that lead can have on a developing brain and body are well-documented. In 1978, a largely successful campaign to remove lead from home paint products resulted in a new law, after it was found that small children could mistakenly eat paint chips and be exposed to lead poisoning. When it comes to levels of lead in water, no true amount is safe. However, in 1991 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established an action level for lead in public drinking water at 15 micrograms per liter, and required water supplies to routinely test household tap water to check lead levels.These laws and others were established to protect our citizens from both indirect and direct exposure to the harmful compound. A person can be directly exposed to lead by drinking contaminated water with unsafe levels, while indirect exposure can occur when a person inhales contaminated water particles through steam or vapors.Once lead enters the human body, the heavy metal attaches itself to cells that can begin to build up in bones or major organs like the liver or kidneys. It disrupts the normal cellular biology of the organ and can lead to chronic diseases. However, the most dangerous damage lead poisoning can inflict is on the brain, especially in young or unborn children. If lead is deposited in a developing fetal brain, it can disrupt the normal function and cause irreversible damage. The same can happen in young children whose brains are still maturing.The consequences can result in low IQ, severe delays in cognitive function, significant disruption in the memory center of the brain, learning disabilities and other neurological deficits. The devastating part of this diagnosis is that it is, for the most part, irreversible. Patients exposed to acute lead poisoning can be treated through chelation, which is a method used to filter out the lead. However, for children chronically exposed over a period of time, the damage cannot be undone.This makes the preventable crisis in Flint all the more devastating.I read that the Obama administration is planning to pick Dr. Nicole Lurie to act as a “czar” and fix the crisis in Flint, but I urge her to look further than just Michigan. Lurie and others must start to seriously evaluate other areas of America where the people are most susceptible to a disaster such as this.

"WASHINGTON -- Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy (D) will sign an executive order on Monday barring state-funded travel to Indiana because of the state's new law that could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers for religious reasons.Malloy's move would make Connecticut the first state to boycott Indiana over its Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which Gov. Mike Pence (R) quietly signed into law last week. The law allows businesses in the state to cite religious beliefs as a legal defense. Opponents fear it offers legal protection for businesses to refuse service to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.Two cities, San Francisco and Seattle, have imposed similar bans in response to the law. Businesses have also retaliated. Angie's List is pulling a campus expansion project in Indianapolis, and the CEO of Salesforce, a $4 billion software corporation, announced plans to ""dramatically reduce our investment"" in the state because of the law.Twenty states have RFRA laws, but Indiana's law is substantially different. While other state RFRAs apply to disputes between a person and a government, Indiana's law goes further and applies to disputes between private citizens. That means, for example, a business owner could use the law to justify discrimination against customers who might otherwise be protected under law.The Indiana law could result in ""employers, landlords, small business owners, or corporations, taking the law into their own hands and acting in ways that violate generally applicable laws on the grounds that they have a religious justification for doing so,"" reads their letter. ""Members of the public will then be asked to bear the cost of their employer's, their landlord's, their local shopkeeper's, or a police officer's private religious beliefs.""That's in sharp contrast to states like Connecticut, which has an RFRA but one that pertains only to religious institutions, not private establishments. And unlike some other states, Connecticut also doesn't permit discrimination based on sexual orientation in any private establishment or institution.Before signing the order, he called the Indiana law ""disturbing and outright discriminatory,"" and said the National Collegiate Athletic Association should relocate its Final Four tournament from Indiana to another state. Those games are set to begin later this week.""I think that would be a wise choice for them to do if that's possible,"" said Malloy. ""I'll leave it up to them to make those decisions.""The NCAA president Mark Emmert has said he is ""surprised and disappointed"" by Indiana's law, and that he is waiting for some kind of clarification to the law, or an outright repeal, before deciding whether to keep holding sporting events in the state.Malloy said his executive order allows for any of the state's current contractual obligations with Indiana to play out, but said he doesn't plan to enter into any new ones.""Somebody's got to stand up to this kind of bigotry and I'm prepared to do it,"" he said.","Create a mindfulness meditation script, inspired by the themes of the article.",The law has sparked widespread criticism and several states have implemented similar bans.**Mindfulness Meditation Script:****Setting:** A quiet and comfortable space.**Duration:** 5 minutes.**Instructions:****1.

"""From the start,"" Hillary Clinton declared today in Reno, ""Donald Trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia. He has taken hate groups mainstream, and [is] helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party."" The speech that followed those words was an extended argument that her opponent is a racist, a conspiracy theorist, and a man temperamentally unfit to be president.Clinton's campaign had promoted this in advance as an address about ""Donald Trump and his advisors' embrace of the disturbing 'alt-right' political philosophy""—the alt-right being an umbrella term for an assortment of racist micro-movements and online subcultures. Yesterday I suggested that making the alt-right the stars of such a speech could only give a signal boost to what is, after all, a rather obscure political faction. But Clinton's comments about that faction took up only about a minute of her remarks. And while that minute was pretty juicy, the alt-right wasn't really the rally's star villain after all.The star villain was Donald Trump. Everyone else that Clinton brought into the address—the alt-right, Breitbart, Alex Jones, David Duke, Nigel Farage, Vladimir Putin—was there in a supporting role.Some of Clinton's arguments didn't make a lot of sense. She led her litany, oddly, by quoting Trump's recent remarks about how bad blacks have it in America. (""Poverty. Rejection. Horrible education. No housing. No homes. No ownership. Crime at levels nobody has seen."") Most people would call his comments a clumsy attempt to reassure voters that he cares about the black community's problems, but Clinton declared them ""a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters."" She also wildly overstated the alt-right's influence, declaring that ""the de facto merger between Breitbart and the Trump campaign"" means the alt-rightists have ""effectively taken over the Republican Party."" She was on sturdier ground at other moments, as when she mentioned Trump's habit of retweeting white nationalists or his false claim that he watched thousands of New Jersey Muslims cheer the 9/11 attacks.Running through all her claims, both the weak ones and the strong ones, was one basic theme: Donald Trump is a bigot and a nut. And while that's an idea you've been hearing ever since the mogul turned reality TV star entered the race, this was as forceful and concentrated an expression of it as I've ever heard emerge from Hillary Clinton's mouth. It's bound to fire up her supporters, and I expect it will help her get out the vote. Whether it also leads a bunch of curious conservatives to Google ""alt-right"" depends, I suppose, on how much coverage that minute of the speech gets in the next few days.But the guy who must be really delighted right now is Alex Jones. Hillary Clinton just attacked him by name! His listeners will be hearing clips from this speech til Ragnarok.","Transform the article into a series of frequently asked questions (FAQs) and answers, providing a clear and concise overview of the topic.",**FAQs:****Q: What is the alt-right and what did Clinton say about it?**A: The alt-right is an umbrella term for a collection of racist micro-movements and online subcultures.

"WASHINGTON -- The Senate advanced legislation Monday night to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, even though President Barack Obama has already said he would veto it.The Senate voted 63-32 to clear a procedural hurdle and begin debate on the bill. Ten Democrats and one independent, Angus King (Maine), voted with every Republican to move the bill forward. Those Democrats included Sens. Michael Bennet (Colo.), Tom Carper (Del.), Bob Casey (Pa.), Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), Joe Manchin (W.Va.), Claire McCaskill (Mo.), Jon Tester (Mont.), Tom Udall (N.M.) and Mark Warner (Va.). A final vote is expected later this week.Despite the strong vote, the Senate lacks the two-thirds majority vote needed to overcome a veto. The House passed the bill last week by a vote of 266 to 153 -- also shy of the 290 votes needed to clear a veto.Congressional action on Keystone comes after the Nebraska Supreme Court cleared the way last week for the proposed pipeline's route through the state. The Obama administration had been waiting for the Nebraska ruling to render its own decision on the pipeline, which is still forthcoming.White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Friday that the State Department is examining the court's decision as part of its process to evaluate whether the Keystone XL Pipeline project serves the national interest.""As we have made clear, we are going to let that process play out,"" Schultz said. ""Regardless of the Nebraska ruling today, the House bill still conflicts with longstanding Executive branch procedures regarding the authority of the President and prevents the thorough consideration of complex issues that could bear on U.S. national interests, and if presented to the President, he will veto the bill.""This article has been updated to include additional details on which senators voted to move the bill forward.","Rewrite the article focusing on its impact at a local level, even if the original story has national or international significance.","The bill cleared a procedural hurdle and began debate with a vote of 63-32.

"One of two crew members survived the shooting down of a Russian warplane by Turkey on Tuesday, Russian officials say, and was rescued by a Syrian commando unit in an operation that ended early Wednesday.The news comes as international tensions continue to rise over the incident. As we reported Tuesday, Turkey says the Russian Su-24 fighter jet was in Turkish airspace when it was shot down by Turkish F-16s. Turkey says it warned the Russian warplane 10 times before taking action.Russia maintains the jet was flying over Syria at the time.Both Russian crew members appeared to eject from the jet and parachute to the ground, but one was reportedly found dead Tuesday by a Syrian rebel group.Russia now says the other crew member has been rescued.

""Russia says one of the helicopter crewmen was killed, but the rest were evacuated safely.""Meanwhile, Russia and Turkey continue to exchange angry rhetoric while at the same time calling for military restraint.Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Wednesday that Russia could not justify its attacks on ethnic Turks in Syria under the pretext of fighting the Islamic State, and reiterated statements by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that Turkey will continue to defend its airspace.But, Davutoglu said, targeting Russia is ""out of the question,"" Reuters reports.Also on Wednesday, Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, called the shooting of the plane a ""planned provocation"" that is prompting Moscow to ""reconsider relations with Ankara,"" The Associated Press reports.

"The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., today is holding its first Sunday service following a horrific shooting that killed nine members of a Bible study group there.Dylann Roof, 21 — who has apparently expressed strong racist and white supremacist views — is charged in the Wednesday night killings, in which nine members of a Bible study group at the historic black church were shot dead. Emanuel AME's pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pickney, was among those killed.As parishioners and visitors fanned themselves against the heat of the first day of summer, the service opened at 9:30 a.m. EDT to filled pews. Hundreds more gathered outside the church.The service opened with the hymns ""Praise God, From Whom All Blessings Flow"" and ""Blessed Assurance.""The Rev. Norvel Goff said: ""we still believe prayer changes things. ... prayer not only changes things, it changes us.""""Many hearts are broken and tears being shed,"" he said. ""Through it all we are reminded that we serve a God who still cares.""Delivering the sermon later, he acknowledged ""it has been tough. It has been rough. Some of us have been downright angry.""But, he said, ""We have shown the world how we as a group of people can come together and pray and work out things that need to be worked out, to make a better state and place to live.""He thanked Gov. Nikki Haley for making sure ""the perpetrator that committed that heinous act was pursued and captured and brought back to South Carolina.""He also thanked Charleston Mayor Joseph Ripley and law enforcement.""I have no problem with doing it,"" he said to loud applause.""We have difficulties ahead, but the only way evil can triumph is for good folks to sit down and do nothing,"" he said.Earlier, the Rev. John H. Gillison prayed that ""in life there are ups and downs. There are dark days, but there are also bright days.""He called on God to ""guide and strengthen those families who were victimized,"" and referring to Wednesday's tragedy said ""the devil tried to take charge.""""But the devil cannot take control of your people and cannot take control of your church,"" Gillison said.NPR's Debbie Elliott, reporting from the church, says: ""It's a very emotional day for the city of Charleston.

"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, along with attorneys general in 10 other states, are suing the Obama administration over the president's directive to allow transgender students to use whatever bathroom that matches their gender preference.The lawsuit is an attempt to make sure states can ignore the federal government's mandate.The 10 other states joining the lawsuit include Arkansas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Tennessee, Maine, Louisiana, Utah and Georgia.They're asking the courts to declare the directive unlawful, accusing the administration of engineering a ""massive social experiment, flouting the democratic process, and running roughshod over commonsense policies protecting children and basic privacy rights.""Supporters of the lawsuit argue that in addition to violating privacy and safety rights of women and children, the White House directive is a major overreach of power.""Simply put, the Obama administration is creating new law, outside the boundaries of the Constitution - making changes only Congress can make,"" Paxton said.""I think the problem with the way the Obama administration has carried this out is that they haven't candidly assessed the cost of this type of policy,"" Trotter said on NPR.""So we understand that women need privacy. They need safety in places that they frequent. And yet the Obama administration has decided to reinterpret an old law that never included transgender people for over 40 years,"" she said.Trotter said the president is doing this from a Washington one-size-fits-all edict instead of going through Congress and having a national discussion.Some schools are now worried if they don't comply, they will lose funding.""We don't have a rule of law if we can reinterpret a more than 40-year-old law and say that the plain language, the black letter of the law is meaningless because someone has become enlightened about it,"" Trotter said.Texas' lieutenant governor previously went as far as to say the state is willing to give up the $10 billion it receives in federal education dollars rather than comply.The directive from the U.S. Justice and Education Departments represents an escalation in what the Obama administration calls a civil rights issue.""This is about the dignity and respect we accord our fellow citizens and the laws that we, as a people and as a country, have enacted to protect them - indeed, to protect all of us,"" U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said.This isn't the only legal fight over transgender rights. Earlier this month the Justice Department and the state of North Carolina sued each other over a state law curbing public restroom access for transgender people.The question of whether federal civil rights law protects those who identify as transgender has no definitive answer and will likely be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.Still, schools that refuse to comply with the Obama administration's directive could very likely be hit with civil rights lawsuits from the government and a cutoff from federal aid to education.","Incorporate historical context into the article, comparing and contrasting the events or information with similar historical events or trends.","The lawsuit challenges the president's directive allowing transgender students to use bathrooms that match their gender preference.The directive, issued by the U.S. Justice and Education Departments, is part of the Obama administration's ongoing efforts to protect the civil rights of transgender"
"As Congress's vote on a resolution to disapprove the administration's nuclear deal draws ever nearer, the math for President Obama is looking better and better.The magic number of Senate supporters the president needs to ensure that the deal stands is 34. Currently, he has 30. So he needs to pick up just four more to preserve the agreement — and there are still 14 remaining undecided Democrats in the chamber, several of whom have already made positive comments about the deal. So Obama has a lot of options.And tellingly, after a month of intense criticism of the deal from the right and from pro-Israel groups, only two Senate Democrats have been swayed to oppose the deal so far: Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York and Bob Menendez of New Jersey. They'll be joined by, it appears, every single Senate Republican.But that wouldn't be enough to sink the deal. If opponents want to block the sanctions relief that's crucial to the agreement, they need to assemble a two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate that can override a promised veto from Obama. And that's impossible to reach without a lot of Democratic votes, as I wrote in July:Deal opponents once hoped that the agreement would become politically toxic, leading to many Democratic defections. But that hasn't happened. Instead, the key swing votes — including some of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate, like Claire McCaskill and Joe Donnelly — have been won over by the administration.The state of play in the House is tougher for outsiders to gauge, but opponents appear to be well short of the 44 Democratic opponents they need there — just 14 Democrats have said they'll vote to kill the deal, according to the Hill. Again, the deal's opponents would need a veto-proof majority in both the Senate and the House to keep the sanctions in place.According to a Friday report from Eli Lake and Josh Rogin of Bloomberg View, deal opponents have already resigned themselves to losing the vote eventually. Furthermore, they write, ""Many Republicans now acknowledge in private that they were handed both a political and a policy defeat on the nuclear deal.""Now that the deal looks so likely to be upheld, the new question is whether Democrats can save President Obama from having to veto it in the first place.There wouldn't be any policy stakes here — achieving this would simply save the president from the embarrassment of Congress passing a resolution condemning his administration's foreign policy.For that to happen, 41 Senate Democrats would have to vote to filibuster the GOP's planned disapproval resolution — meaning Obama would need to win over 11 of the remaining 14 undecided Democrats in the chamber. That's a tall order, but given that only two Democratic senators have opposed the deal so far, it doesn't seem completely out of the question.The vote will likely take place in mid-September. But if you want to keep track yourself beforehand, here are the remaining undecided Democratic senators. Again, the administration needs to win four of their votes to uphold the deal, and 11 for a filibuster that would make a veto unnecessary:","Reframe the text as an escape room scenario, with puzzles and challenges based on the story.","You find yourself in the heart of a political battle, where the fate of a nuclear deal hangs in the balance. The clock is ticking as Congress prepares to vote on a resolution to disapprove the deal.

Currently, he has 30, leaving him with a deficit of four votes."
"After a week of nonstop criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike for comments many condemned as racially charged, Donald Trump claims to be altering his campaign to be a little more inclusive. While the presumptive G.O.P. has long promised to “make America great again,” Trump now says he’s adding two words to slogan to illustrate just how non-racist he really is.“You know, I have the theme ‘make America great again,’ and I've added a couple of things,” Trump announced to supporters at a campaign rally in Richmond, Virginia, on Friday night. “Right now I’m adding make America great again—I’m adding ‘for everyone,’ because it’s really going to be for everyone. It’s not going to be for a group of people, it’s going to be for everyone. It’s true.”The allegedly amended slogan, which has yet to appear on any official signage or Trump merchandise, comes after the presidential candidate spent the first half of June repeatedly denouncing Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge of Mexican heritage presiding over the Trump University class action lawsuit, as inherently biased against him. (Curiel was born in Indiana.) His comments were widely condemned by the Washington political establishment, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who suggested he may be an idiot, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who called Trump’s statement the “textbook definition of a racist comment.”Trump, who hasn’t apologized or taken back any of his comments, indicated on Friday that he realized his words have had a negative effect on his campaign and declared he is not a racist.“I am the least racist person.

"Implausible schemes to put Mike Pence, rather than Donald Trump, on the top of the ballot have been flying since a once-secret recording of Trump’s lurid boasting about sexual assault leaked to the public on Friday evening.Pence has issued a public statement on Trump’s remarks, saying he “does not condone his remarks and cannot defend them” — but accepted Trump’s apology and suggested he’d stick by him through the second presidential debate on Sunday night. Anonymous sources say privately Pence is “beside himself” over the details in the leaked audio.Meanwhile, multiple prominent Republicans — from former rival for the nomination Carly Fiorina to former Bush Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and a number of members of Congress — have called for Trump to step aside and allow Pence to be the nominee.On some level, the Republican longing for Pence in the face of these new details about Trump’s past makes sense. He’s an experienced politician with a long track record. He has impeccable social conservative credentials. He’s the governor of a state. He can pay attention in a debate long enough to land punches on Tim Kaine. And he has almost certainly never been secretly recorded talking about a woman’s “tits” or “pussy” or bragging about kissing women against their will.But if Republican politicians are really horrified by Trump’s remarks — and not just by the possible electoral implications — Pence made one decision that should disqualify him in their eyes, too: Mike Pence agreed to be Donald Trump’s vice president.Pence lent Trump the legitimacy he needed to unite the Republican Party. He spent months apologizing for Trump, explaining what Trump really meant, and doing everything he could to put Trump in the Oval Office.Trump himself pointed to “party unity” as one of the key reasons for choosing Pence as his running mate in the first place, making no secret of the role he viewed the Indiana governor as playing in the campaign.It’s not as if Pence didn’t know what he was doing. By the time Trump picked him as his running mate on July 14, Trump had already:Nor was Trump’s rampant sexism a secret. His public feuds with celebrities aside, the New York Times had already published a long article on times Trump was accused of crossing boundaries with women in his private life.And, of course, Trump had spent years publicly doubting that President Obama was born in the United States.This is not a complete list. But by the time Trump was picking a running mate, it was clear that he was a man with a history of bigoted, racist, sexist behavior and remarks. This is what Pence agreed to make palatable to the Republican establishment, to social conservatives, and to swing voters.Pence was going against his own principles, as these tweets from before he joined the ticket show:And Pence has stood by Trump throughout the ensuing controversies — Trump’s fights with a Gold Star family and the 1997 Miss Universe among them. He’s watched Trump tell black voters that they should vote for him because “What do you have to lose?” and say that the Central Park Five, proved innocent by DNA evidence, should have been executed anyway.To characterize Pence as a paragon of respect and decency who happened to wake up one morning and, through no fault of his own, be Trump’s running mate ignores the role Pence played in trying to make Trump palatable to voters and the establishment in the first place.If the case against Trump’s presidency is his poor judgment and his lack of respect for women, what does Pence’s tacit approval of all of this say about him?",Convert into a dialogue between two people with opposing views on the subject.,"**John:** ""I believe that Mike Pence should be the Republican Party's presidential nominee instead of Donald Trump.

"The Alabama Judicial Inquiry Commission charged Chief Justice Roy Moore, an outspoken opponent of same-sex unions, with violating the state's judicial ethics laws, an allegation that could potentially remove him from office, according to news website AL.com.The legality of gay marriage had been at the center of a national debate for years until the Supreme Court ruled in June that the U.S. Constitution provides same-sex couples the right to marry, handing a historic triumph to the American gay rights movement.Despite the ruling and a federal court ruling that made gay marriage legal in Alabama, Moore issued in January an administrative order to state probate judges, ordering them not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, according to court documents.""Chief Justice Moore flagrantly disregarded and abused his authority,"" the complaint said.

"WASHINGTON -- While the Obama administration's decision to designate ISIS's atrocities against Christians and other minorities as ""genocide"" is important, many warn that it's only the beginning of the process.""In my judgment Daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in territory under its control,"" Kerry said, using the Arabic acronym for the jihadist army.It's a critical first step towards protecting Christians from ISIS and other Islamic radicals in Iraq and Syria.""Every jihadist in the Middle East believes they can kill, kidnap, enslave and otherwise torture Christians and other religious minorities and they believe they can do it without repercussions,"" said Johnnie Moore, author of the book Defying ISIS.In northern Iraq, Assyrian Christians are an ancient people descended from the first followers of Christ.""As Assyrians of the Middle East we are on the verge of extinction,"" warned Juliana Taimoorazy, founder and president of the Iraqi Christian Relief Council, an organization that raises awareness about the persecuted Church in Iraq.Taimoorazy recently visited Telskuf in the Nineveh Plains of Iraq, where 200,000 Christians have fled from ISIS.""The homes are destroyed when you walk inside,"" she said. ""Their closets are all broken, the beds are all overturned - the kitchens are destroyed.""Secretary Kerry's genocide designation helps keep the plight of these Christians near the front of U.S. foreign policy.Advocates wasted no time celebrating. They're already working with the State Department to ensure Christians are represented in Syrian peace talks and that property rights for those forced to flee their homes in Iraq are enforced.""There are going to be borders redrawn, constitutions redrafted,"" Nina Shea, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, told CBN News.""It's absolutely essential that the Christians have a voice in this process or they will have no place in the new Syria or in the new Iraq,"" she warned.There's already an effort to create a safe haven in the Nineveh Plains so that Christians, Yazidis and other minorities can return home, govern themselves and rebuild their lives without fear of extermination.""If you care about the presence of Christianity, the Christian witness, in this very Gospel poor part of the world you will support the idea of a safe haven,"" Robert Nicholson, executive director of the Philos Project, told CBN News.In spite of the horrors they've experienced at the hands of ISIS, Christians in this part of the world are experiencing a revival of their faith.""They have told me repeatedly it's because of persecution that has been inflicted on them that they have grown closer to Christ that they find themselves praying more that they're thirsty for the Gospel more,"" Taimoorazy said.Now the same advocates who pushed for the genocide designation are moving to keep up the pressure, hoping to ensure the Obama administration not only talks, but acts to protect those persecuted Christians and other religious minorities.They hope to make real progress before the next administration moves into the White House.","Transform the article into a telegraph message, conveying the essence in a concise and historic format.","The situation in northern Iraq and Syria is dire for Christians and other religious minorities.

"Dragging on for an excruciating eternity, this election season has demeaned democracy, elevated mediocrity and insulted and embarrassed us all on just about every level imaginable: Intellectually, with regard to the lack of focus on policy and substance; ethically, with a complete disregard for integrity and character; and morally, driven by a disgraceful descent into racist and xenophobic vitriol.Given that our country has consistently climbed down the educational attainment ladder, and that inane and banal reality TV shows draw more eyeballs than books and opera , it should not surprise us that a growing swath of the electorate is more enthused by a coarse, bullying celebrity than by an awkward policy wonk.But what's doubly disappointing -- as we head into the crucial presidential debates -- is that this lack of intellectual depth is enabled not only by the candidates, but also by the topics they gravitate to, which the media frenzy then exacerbates.These are topics that don't matter when it comes to making a difference in the future of our country: the size of a candidate's hands (and therefore other body parts), the now-moot birther issue, the Monica Lewinsky and Marla Maples scandals, the name-calling and finger pointing about who is more racist than whom, who is healthier than whom.","Design a museum exhibit layout, featuring sections related to the article's content.",The Demeaning of Democracy:**- This section would feature a timeline highlighting the key events that have led to the current state of democracy in the United States.- Display quotes from the article that illustrate the negative impact of the election season on democracy.- Include interactive elements that allow visitors to reflect on the state of democracy and their

"Donald Trump is surging in new battleground and national polls at a time when Hillary Clinton faces tough questions not only about her health but her sweeping criticism of her Republican opponent’s supporters.Several surveys appear to show the Republican presidential nominee effectively ending, at least for now, a post-convention slump that saw Clinton leading in virtually every swing state. Now, a Monmouth University Poll shows Trump taking a narrow 2-point lead in Nevada; a Bloomberg Politics poll shows Trump leading Clinton by 5 points in Ohio; and new CNN/ORC polls show Trump leading in Florida and Ohio.In the latter survey, Trump leads 46-41 percent among likely voters in Ohio, and 47-44 percent among likely voters in Florida.“We’ve really had a good month,” Trump told Fox News’ “Fox & Friends,” claiming he’s enjoying renewed “enthusiasm” from voters.Clinton, though, plans to return to the campaign trail Thursday afternoon after taking three days off to recover from a bout of pneumonia. While her campaign dispatched high-powered surrogates to the stump in her absence -- including Bill Clinton and President Obama -- the Democratic nominee’s presence could help reset the race once again.The contest remains tight, and the polls are hardly uniform. A Quinnipiac University national poll released Wednesday showed Clinton leading 48-43 percent among likely voters.But that still represents a narrowing of the race since a late-August survey showing Clinton up 10 points.The recent surveys come as Clinton grapples with new controversies on two fronts: Her comment at a Friday fundraiser that half of Trump’s backers are in a “basket of deplorables,” and her campaign’s handling of a health scare on Sunday during a 15th anniversary ceremony honoring victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.Clinton has since expressed regret for her “deplorables” comment, though Trump has called on her to outright retract it. And Clinton’s campaign has sought to answer questions about the former secretary of state's health, after Clinton was seen stumbling at the 9/11 memorial event in New York City.The campaign said she was overheated and dehydrated, and revealed she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. While the incident revived long-simmering questions about her health, the campaign on Wednesday released additional medical details. Dr. Lisa Bardack, Clinton’s physician, said she is “recovering well with antibiotics and rest.”Bardack also said Clinton remains “healthy and fit to serve.”Trump, too, has tried to answer questions about his own health. He discussed the results of a recent physical with TV’s “Dr. Oz,” and told Fox News on Thursday “they were good.” The discussion with “Dr. Oz” will air on his show Thursday.Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign maintains they always knew states like Ohio would be competitive – and they are building out their operation there.The campaign announced that they will open a half-dozen new offices in the state, bringing their total to 54.","Convert the news article into an opinion piece, providing a strong stance or viewpoint on the events or information discussed.","The recent surge in Donald Trump's poll numbers is a testament to the Republican presidential nominee's ability to capitalize on the post-convention slump that had seen Hillary Clinton leading in virtually every swing state.

"WASHINGTON -- Senate leaders announced Tuesday that they've resolved a weeks-long standoff over a sex trafficking bill containing controversial anti-abortion language, clearing the way, at last, for U.S. attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch to get her confirmation vote.Lynch has been waiting for more than five months for a confirmation vote. Most recently, Republican leaders tied the vote to passage of the trafficking bill. That bill has nothing to do with Lynch, but as long as it wasn't moving, neither was Lynch's confirmation.Aides to Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas) have been working for weeks to break the impasse. As introduced, the bill would have collected fees from sex traffickers and put them into a new victims fund that would be subject to the Hyde Amendment, the federal provision that bars the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape and incest. Democrats objected to the abortion language in general, but more so because the bill expanded the Hyde Amendment to include private funds.Under the deal announced Tuesday, the bill will create two funding streams. The first one flows from fines collected from sex traffickers, and would be used for survivor services excluding health care. This stream would not include Hyde Amendment restrictions. The second one would come from community health center funds that are already subject to the abortion limits.The deal lets both parties walk away with a solid talking point: Democrats can celebrate that they prevented an expansion of Hyde, while Republicans can say they didn't cave on restricting abortion funds.""I’m pleased that we were able to reach a deal that gets this done in a way that does not expand restrictions on women’s health to non-taxpayer dollars or to new programs, and provides survivors with real dedicated funds for the support and services they need,"" Murray said on the Senate floor.A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he expects the Senate to pass the sex trafficking bill on Wednesday. From there, the Senate will move to Lynch's confirmation vote.McConnell said the attorney general nominee should get a vote ""in the next day or so.""Last week, President Barack Obama fumed that Republicans have made Lynch wait for so long, saying the delay is just ""embarrassing.""CORRECTION: This story previously misstated the nature of the survivor services that would benefit from the funding collected from sex trafficking fines under the legislation. Those services would not include health care.","Convert the news article into an opinion piece, providing a strong stance or viewpoint on the events or information discussed.","It is a story that highlights the complex interplay between various factors, including the Hyde Amendment, abortion rights, and the well-being of victims of sex trafficking.The bill, initially introduced with the intention of combating sex trafficking, unfortunately included language that expanded the Hyde Amendment to include private funds.

"Washington (CNN) Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is standing his ground in his belief that allowing transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice ""opens the door for predators,"" dismissing criticism from Caitlyn Jenner, who mocked him over the issue last week.""This is not a matter of right or left, or Democrat or Republican. This is common sense. It doesn't make sense for grown adult men, strangers, to be alone in a restroom with a little girl,"" Cruz told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union.""""This is the height of political correctness,"" Cruz continued. ""And frankly, the concern is not of the Caitlyn Jenners of the world, but if the law is such that any man, if he feels like it, can go in a woman's restroom and you can't ask him to leave, that opens the door for predators.""Jenner, a reality TV star and activist for transgender causes, posted a video to Facebook on Wednesday knocking Cruz for his support of a controversial North Carolina law that requires people to use the bathroom that corresponds with their ""biological sex"" stated on their birth certificate, rather than how they self-identify.After using a women's bathroom in the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City -- following a recent comment by Trump in which he said Jenner could use whichever bathroom she wanted at the tower -- Jenner, a Republican, quipped: ""By the way, Ted, nobody got molested.""""I've spent a lot of years in law enforcement dealing with child predators that are sick individuals,"" Cruz told Tapper. ""That doesn't mean that that is the people who are transgendered. But there are predators in the world, and just saying that you're a man, you can go in the girls' restroom if you feel like it, opens the door for criminals.""""This is the height of political correctness for Donald Trump to say yes, let grown men in the bathroom with little girls,"" he said.Cruz told Tapper that Fiorina's words owed to her being a tough competitor.""She was a competitor in this primary. She was a fierce competitor in a primary people take shots at each other. That's part of the process,"" Cruz said. ""You know, we all remember when Ronald Reagan picked George Herbert Walker Bush as his vice president and they had to explain why Bush had called Reaganomics 'voodoo economics.' Listen, that happens when you come through a primary and you unite.""Cruz added: ""I can tell you Carly and I have spent weeks and weeks and weeks together on the road barnstorming the state of Indiana, barnstorming the country, and I have gotten to know and respect Carly. She's an extraordinary leader.""Boehner 'let out his inner Trump'Asked about the criticism, Cruz shrugged it off.""I think Boehner kinda let out his inner Trump, and he had some colorful imagery there. But it's interesting, when Boehner was attacking me, he praised Hillary Clinton. He thinks she's terrific, and he praised Donald Trump. He said Donald is his friend, his golfing buddy, his texting buddy,"" Cruz said. ""And there's a reason -- if you like, if you want to see the next president as a Boehner Republican, then Donald Trump is your man.""So why does Boehner dislike Cruz?""If you look at Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and John Boehner, they're all part of the same corrupt Washington system where the rich get richer (and) the powerful and the lobbyists use government power for personal benefit,"" Cruz said.'Behind the Donald Trump mask is Hillary Clinton'""You know who I feel the worst for?

"Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton continues to be a dominant force heading into the 2016 presidential election, according to a new CNN/ORC poll . The former secretary of state maintains a broad lead over the field of potential Democratic challengers she could face in a nomination contest and sizable advantages over the leading contenders from the Republican side in general election match-ups.But none of the top candidates in this field gets within 10 points of Hillary Clinton in a series of hypothetical general election matchups.Rand Paul comes closest, with 43% saying they'd be more likely to back him while 54% choose Clinton. The two candidates who currently top the GOP field, Bush and Walker, match up equally against Clinton, with each carrying 40% to her 55%. Huckabee gets 41% to Clinton's 55% and Carson has 40% to Clinton's 56%.Should Warren decide not to get into the race, Clinton stands to benefit more than others, gaining 5 points and holding a 67% to 16% advantage over Biden when Warren's backers are re-allocated to their second-choice candidate. Notably, with Warren out of the race, Clinton surges from 67% support to 74% among Democratic women.And Democrats broadly believe the party's chances to hold the White House in 2016 are strongest with Clinton; 68% say so, while 30% say the party would have a better shot with someone else leading the ticket.Though Clinton's favorability rating has taken a hit recently, her prospects in 2016 appear largely unchanged compared to polls conducted before news broke about her use of a personal email address and home-based server while serving as secretary of state.On the Republican side, Bush leads the pack with 16%, Walker follows at 13%, Paul nearly matches him at 12% and Huckabee holds 10% support. Huckabee's backing has dipped significantly since February, from 16% to 10%, while the others near the top have generally held steady. In single digits, Carson holds 9%, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has 7%, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has 7%. The rest of the field lands below 5%, including 2012 candidates Rick Santorum at 1% and Rick Perry at 4%.Some interesting demographic trends emerge in the GOP numbers: There is something of a gender gap in preferences, with both Walker (17% among men, 9% among women) and Paul (16% among men, 7% among women) doing significantly better with men than women. Younger Republicans are more likely to back Paul than older ones (he has 17% support among Republicans under 50, just 7% among older Republicans).Bush's backing generally holds steady across demographic divides, but he fares better among self-identified Republicans (22%) than independents who lean toward the party (10%), while Paul outperforms among independents (17% compared with 7% among self-identified Republicans).Yet many of the GOP's strongest contenders remain largely unknown. Majorities of Americans haven't yet formed opinions about Scott Walker (58%) or Ben Carson (64%), and about half haven't heard of or don't know about Marco Rubio (48%).Even the best known Republican contender, Jeb Bush, prompts nearly a quarter of Americans to say they're not sure how they feel about him (23%). Republicans themselves have heard a bit more about their party's top potential candidates, but only one merits a majority favorable rating among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents: Mike Huckabee at 57% favorable.The CNN/ORC International poll was conducted by telephone March 13-15 and included interviews with 1,009 adult Americans. For results among the full sample, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. For results among the 450 Republicans or Republican-leaning independents, or among the 466 Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents, it is 4.5 points.","Conceive as a children's book story, simplifying complex ideas into engaging narratives.","Hillary Clinton continues to be a dominant force heading into the 2016 presidential election.

"In a marketing fiasco that could rank right up there with “New Coke,” Starbucks has ditched its plan to have baristas ignite a national discussion on race after critics advised the chain its view of black and white should revolve around coffee and milk.The baristas had begun writing ""Race Together"" on customers' cups, as a means of starting a conversation with customers, but the practice ended Sunday after just one week, said company spokesman Jim Olson. But the chain's initiative will continue more broadly without the handwritten messages, Starbucks spokesman Jim Olson said.The cups were always ""just the catalyst"" for a larger conversation and Starbucks will still hold forum discussions, co-produce special sections in USA Today and put more stores in minority communities as part of the Race Together initiative, according to a company memo from CEO Howard Schultz said.The campaign has been criticized as opportunistic and inappropriate, coming in the wake of racially charged events such as national protests over police killings of black males. Others questioned whether Starbucks workers could spark productive conversations about race while serving drinks.The critics blasted Corey duBrowa, the company's senior vice president of global communications, on Twitter after the plan was first announced, calling it patronizing at best and inflammatory at worst. The executive was forced to delete his Twitter account, although he re-activated it the next day.“Last night I felt personally attacked in a cascade of negativity,” he tweeted. “I got overwhelmed by the volume and tenor of the discussion, and I reacted.”The phase-out is not a reaction to that pushback, Olson said.

"They came close in Iowa, but just fell short of claiming victory. Tuesday night in New Hampshire was a different story.The political outsiders have taken control of this election.Donald Trump won Tuesday night’s Republican primary in New Hampshire. By a margin of 34 percent to 16 percent for John Kasich, Trump proved that his slogan of “Make America Great Again” resonates with voters – in a big way.On the Democratic side, self proclaimed socialist Bernie Sanders edged Hillary Clinton out by 20 percentage points. His message railing against the rigged economy, special interests that control Washington and pledging to give Americans universal healthcare and free college tuition brought together a larger coalition of young voters than the one Barack Obama built in 2008.To my mind, Tuesday night’s results show that there are finally politicians who understand how marginalized, disenfranchised and betrayed a majority of Americans feel. It’s both Republicans and Democrats, including the 42 percent of Americans who now identify as independent because they think the two parties don’t represent their values and positions.We are seeing a full scale rejection of the political establishment. This is a threat that we did not take seriously enough over the past few years, as evidenced by the fact that most rejected Trump as a clown and a joke. His ideas on illegal immigration and placing a temporary ban on Muslims ruffled our national feathers even though a majority of Republican primary voters agreed with him. That’s how out of touch our political class has become.Indeed, 46 percent of GOP voters say they feel betrayed by Republican politicians. Trump won 32 percent of that group.We did the same thing to Bernie Sanders who began this race upwards of 50 points behind Hillary Clinton. We said a socialist could never win. And he may not be able to win a national election, but we are seeing an electorate so starved for an honest and trustworthy politician that they will make allowances for ideologies that they may not have considered before.Sanders has argued about oligarchy and money in politics and has been his whole career. He doesn’t flip flop or evolve on his advocacy for the average American.Sanders is just Bernie Sanders. And Donald Trump is just Donald Trump.We are living in a time when trust in Americans institutions has collapsed. A recent Pew survey shows that less than 20 percent of Americans trust the government always or most of the time. And a CNN poll showed that 60 percent think the American Dream is unachievable today.Against this backdrop, it’s no surprise that America is in revolt. Honesty and trustworthiness matters more than whether a candidate has experience or can win in November according to voters. And the establishment isn’t delivering anything resembling what the American populace desires in their political leaders.I see a clearer path to the nomination for Trump than for Sanders, but there is no doubt that Americans have spoken and they’re done with business as usual.Douglas E.

"What the West really needs to take on the Islamic State is ... a jobs program.That's what a top State Department spokeswoman suggested when asked in a TV interview Monday night about what the U.S.-led coalition is doing to stop the slaughter of civilians by Islamic State militants across the region.""We're killing a lot of them, and we're going to keep killing more of them. ... But we cannot win this war by killing them,"" department spokeswoman Marie Harf said on MSNBC's ""Hardball.""

There's always going to be poor Muslims.""Harf continued to argue that the U.S. should work with other countries to ""help improve their governance"" and ""help them build their economies so they can have job opportunities for these people.""She acknowledged there's ""no easy solution"" and said the U.S. would still take out ISIS leaders. But Harf said: ""If we can help countries work at the root causes of this -- what makes these 17-year-old kids pick up an AK-47 instead of trying to start a business?""Asked about Harf's remarks on Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Harf was only making the point that fighting ISIS entails more than just a military solution.The comments come as the Obama administration takes heat from lawmakers for its approach to the Islamic State, whose self-proclaimed fighters in Libya recently executed 21 Coptic Christians from Egypt.The White House on Tuesday kicked off a three-day summit on ""countering violent extremism."" It began with Vice President Biden moderating a discussion on countering extremism with representatives from cities.This, though, follows a pattern of conferences and summits called by the administration to address urgent challenges. The administration is facing criticism for this approach -- and for describing the summit in general terms -- at a time when Islamic State militants are spreading, recruiting and executing prisoners from multiple countries in increasingly brutal ways.""The White House had to seem like it was doing something,"" said Jonah Goldberg, a National Review editor and conservative columnist, while claiming the summit won't achieve much.Senior administration officials, though, defended the conference, and their description of it, on a call with reporters.Asked whether Islamic extremists are in fact the focus of the summit, one official said extremism has spanned ""many decades"" and taken on ""many forms,"" but they recognize that those launching recent attacks ""are calling themselves Muslims.""""You can call them what you want. We're calling them terrorists,"" the official said.The New York Times reported Tuesday that as airstrikes continue in Iraq and Syria, the administration is boosting efforts to counter ISIS on social media.

"As the Democratic presidential contest reaches the third state, what began as a coronation is now an exciting dead heat. Yet by one measure, Bernie Sanders is ­already a clear winner.Regardless of whether the senator from Vermont captures the actual nomination, he has won the future of the Democratic Party.Sanders is demolishing the last remnants of the old order, as represented by Hillary Clinton and her split-the-difference triangulation. It is Sanders, not she, who is the true heir of the radical politics of Barack Obama.Calling a paradigm shift is like forecasting a recession — predict it often enough and you’ll eventually be right. Yet the developments unfolding before our eyes suggest the Democratic Party is undergoing a massive change. And a 74-year-old socialist is the architect.A major piece of evidence is the enormous youth vote he attracts. In Iowa and New Hampshire, he beat Clinton by about 70 points — 84 percent to 15 percent — among voters under age 30. And despite the nasty demands by Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem that women must support Clinton, Sanders got 82 percent of the young female vote.By contrast, Obama in the 2008 primaries typically beat Clinton among young people by about 20 points. With studies showing that most people stay in their first political party for many years, the young, ultra-liberal voters who turned out for Obama, and who are being joined by the Sanders wave, could dominate the party for a generation.Click to read Goodwin’s full column in the New York Post.Michael Goodwin is a Fox News contributor and New York Post columnist.",Summarize the key points as if explaining to a curious ten yours old.,"The Democratic presidential race is getting exciting!

"After his shotgun wedding to the presumptive GOP nominee last week, the House speaker is getting a glimpse of his future with a man who puts his dreams before anyone else’s.There’s no currently available evidence showing that Donald Trump’s entire campaign is just one big, deliberate effort to troll Paul Ryan.Since Ryan allied himself with the mogul, Trump has engaged in some of his worst behavior of the cycle, and his backers show no restraint in their eagerness to malign and mock the Speaker of the House. Any hoped-for Trump/Ryan Era of Good Feelings?On June 2, Ryan endorsed Trump. He said he made that decision because he believes a President Trump will help pass his forthcoming agenda.“Through these conversations, I feel confident he would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people’s lives,” Ryan said. “That’s why I’ll be voting for him this fall.”One day later, Donald Trump welcomed Paul Ryan to the rest of his life by saying the federal judge overseeing a civil case against the now-defunct Trump University is unsuited for the job because he’s of Mexican ancestry (said judge, Gonzalo Curiel, was born in Indiana).Ryan responded to the comments in a press conference he held in Southeast D.C. to roll out the first item on his policy agenda, a series of proposals to fight poverty.The focus of the morning could have been on the fact that House Republicans finally decided to start talking about poverty—an issue their party has long declined to focus on. But the biggest news Paul Ryan made was his response to Trump.“Saying a person can’t do their job because of their race is sort of the textbook definition of racist comments,” he said, saying Trump’s comments on Curiel “should be absolutely disavowed.”“I’m not going to even pretend to defend them,” he added. “I’m going to defend our ideas. I’m going to defend our agenda. What matters to us most is our principles and the policies that come from those principles, and our ability to give the people of this country a better way forward.”Tuesday’s press conference, was suppose to highlight Ryan’s latest attempt to turn the page away from the insanity of the presidential election and back to the serious business of lawmaking. He has spent the past few weeks cutting campaign-style videos teasing the release of a series of proposals from House Republicans.The sad irony of all this is that Trump actually paid lip service to Ryan’s anti-poverty plan when he appeared on CBS’s Face the Nation on June 5.“Paul Ryan—well, I think we will agree on—as an example, he really focuses on poverty,” Trump told host John Dickerson. “He wants to take people out of poverty. So do I. And we’re going to come up with a plan.”But that comment was totally drowned out by the criticism Trump drew for saying on the same show that a Muslim judge would probably be just as unfair to him as a judge of Mexican ancestry.",Turn the text into a set of diary entries from someone affected by the events.,"It feels like there's a new story breaking every day, and I'm not always sure which way to turn.On June 2nd, I was thrilled to hear that House Speaker Paul Ryan had endorsed Donald Trump.

"The Obama administration has made ""virtually no progress"" to increase transparency and accountability for its lethal drone program, a new report has concluded, with only months left to spare before the White House hands control of the targeted killing apparatus to a successor.The report by the nonpartisan Stimson Center said the administration is failing to release fundamental information about the program or to significantly overhaul it — even after a 2015 strike mistakenly left American contractor Warren Weinstein and Italian hostage Giovanni Lo Porto dead.""We have seen relatively few successes,"" said Rachel Stohl, a researcher at the center. ""The administration has been unwilling to provide the number of strikes, even in aggregate; the number of civilian casualties that they estimate that have occurred because of those strikes; the legal justification, unless required by court order, that allows the program to continue; so even on the most basic levels, what is the program doing, we don't know.""A bipartisan task force called on the White House nearly two years ago to reconsider its reliance on targeted killing of suspected terrorists, in part, because the strikes may be doing more harm than good by fomenting hatred overseas. But Stimson researchers said they've uncovered little evidence anything like that reorientation has happened.A senior administration official told NPR the White House goes to ""extraordinary lengths"" to avoid civilian casualties.The official added: ""Unlike our enemies, which deliberately and pointedly violate the law of armed conflict, the United States takes great care to adhere to the fundamental law of armed conflict principle of distinction, which requires that attacks be directed only against military objectives and that civilians and civilian objects not be the target of attack.""At least nine nations now have weaponized drones, and four have used them, the report said. ""It's important that the United States establishes good policy and sets an international precedent that demonstrates leadership and responsibility and transparency over the program because other countries are going to follow the U.S. lead,"" Stohl said.U.S. government officials have walked a fine line on the drone program, which is supposed to be secret. Former CIA and NSA Director Michael Hayden addressed the strikes in his new book and an opinion article in the New York Times Sunday, when he wrote: ""I think it fair to say that the targeted killing program has been the most precise and effective application of firepower in the history of armed conflict.""Days earlier, lawyers for the Obama administration appeared in an appeals court in Washington, D.C., to fight a demand by the American Civil Liberties Union for legal justifications and ""summary strike data,"" including the numbers and identities of people killed by weaponized drones.Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the ACLU, said the administration can't have it both ways.""The law of the drone campaign should not be a secret, nor should the CIA be permitted to withhold basic information that would allow the public to understand the implications of the government's policies,"" Jaffer said.

"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, along with attorneys general in 10 other states, are suing the Obama administration over the president's directive to allow transgender students to use whatever bathroom that matches their gender preference.The lawsuit is an attempt to make sure states can ignore the federal government's mandate.The 10 other states joining the lawsuit include Arkansas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Tennessee, Maine, Louisiana, Utah and Georgia.They're asking the courts to declare the directive unlawful, accusing the administration of engineering a ""massive social experiment, flouting the democratic process, and running roughshod over commonsense policies protecting children and basic privacy rights.""Supporters of the lawsuit argue that in addition to violating privacy and safety rights of women and children, the White House directive is a major overreach of power.""Simply put, the Obama administration is creating new law, outside the boundaries of the Constitution - making changes only Congress can make,"" Paxton said.""I think the problem with the way the Obama administration has carried this out is that they haven't candidly assessed the cost of this type of policy,"" Trotter said on NPR.""So we understand that women need privacy. They need safety in places that they frequent.

"SHARM EL-SHEIK, Egypt, March 14 (Reuters) - On the eve of fresh talks with Iran, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said it was unclear whether an interim agreement over its nuclear power program was within reach.""I can't tell you whether or not we can get a deal, whether we are close,"" Kerry told a news conference on Saturday in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik, where he attended an Egyptian investment summit.""The purpose of these negotiations is not just to get a deal, it is to get the right deal,"" he added.The United States and five other major powers -- Britain, Germany, France, China and Russia -- will resume negotiations with Iran in Lausanne, Switzerland, from Sunday. They hope to clinch a framework agreement by the end of the month.The two sides would then seek to negotiate by June 30 a final agreement to would curb Iran's most sensitive nuclear activities for at least 10 years. In exchange, sanctions on the Islamic Republic would gradually end.Kerry expressed concern again that a letter to Iran last week from Republican senators may have undermined the talks. The letter warned Iran that any deal made by President Barack Obama might last only as long as he remained in office -- a highly unusual intervention in U.S. foreign policy-making.Kerry said he would assure Iranian negotiators and Europeans allies during the upcoming talks that Congress did not have the authority to change the deal.""As far as we're concerned, Congress has no ability to change an executive agreement,"" Kerry said, adding that ""important gaps"" still remained between the sides.The letter followed a speech to Congress earlier this month by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who warned that Obama was negotiating a ""bad deal"" with Iran. Republicans invited Netanyahu to speak about Iran without consulting the White House or Democrats.With Israel preparing to elect a new government next week, Kerry said the United States hoped that whatever the outcome it would help push forward the peace process with Palestinians.""President Obama remains committed to a two-state solution,"" Kerry said, adding ""he remains hopeful that whatever choice that people of Israel make, that there will be an ability to be able to move forward on those efforts.""He declined to elaborate on the prospects of resuming the talks, with an election just days away.Peace talks broke down in April 2014 after nine months of negotiations led by Kerry, with the long-standing goal of a two-state solution no closer.Abbas has steered clear of taking a position on the Israeli election, saying only that he was ready to work with who wins.

"U.S. stocks rallied for a second day on Thursday, boosted by expectations the U.S. economy will continue to improve and by hopes for more aggressive action from the European Central Bank.The S&P 500 added 3 percent over the last two sessions, retracing most of its 4.2 percent loss in the previous five trading days, leaving the index in positive territory for 2015. The Dow and Nasdaq also turned up for the year so far.The advance was broad, with the S&P materials, energy and technology sectors each rising more than 2 percent, leading the day's gains.Though slightly above expectations, initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped from the prior week, pointing to a firming labor market ahead of Friday's key monthly payrolls report.""We're at the point where the jobs reports have been coming in consistently in the 200,000 or 200,000-plus range.

"On behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives, I extend my warmest wishes to everyone celebrating Christmas this year.We spend a lot of time this season asking for what we want. But perhaps it would be better to ask for what we need. We have been given so much in this country that it almost seems ungrateful to ask for more. But all of us—at all times—need more of what is good. And this year, I hope that all of us continue to live in what I consider the spirit of Christmas: a courageous humility.It took courage for God to humble Himself. He came down from heaven and became a man—a child in a manger. He did this while knowing that one day He would have to lay down His life for us. He would have to give up His only Son. At first, this might seem like a sad story. But we are to “rejoice in the Lord always.” Christmas is a day of celebration. And it is only through grace and prayer that we come to realize: what a gift He’s given us—what a profound act of love.And so we rejoice. This year, may we continue the spirit of Christmas by facing our flaws fearlessly and by giving back boldly. May we recognize that our way is not the only way—it is not even the right way. It is God’s way we seek. May we cherish all the gifts we have been given—especially the men and women of our armed forces, the people who keep us safe. And may we remember that it takes courage to put others first. It is courageous to do the right thing.May we remember, and be brave—and be glad.Republican Paul Ryan is Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.

"U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday’s unity march against terrorism.Kerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.The visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.The French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday’s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.Among roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.Kerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi’s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.In a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as “quibbling a little bit.” He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.“But that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,” he said.“And I don’t think the people of France have any doubts about America’s understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.”","Convert the article into a travelogue, describing places, cultures, and experiences mentioned in the story.","U.S. Secretary of State John F.

"The State Department said Tuesday it has no record of Hillary Clinton signing a key form stating she turned over all official documents upon leaving the department -- a form that was the subject of intense speculation since the issue could determine whether she broke the law.That document is known as a ""separation"" form, which officials are supposed to sign upon leaving the department. It certifies that the person who signs it has turned over all ""classified or administratively controlled"" materials, as well as all ""unclassified documents and papers"" relating to official government business.Given that Clinton exclusively used personal email while secretary of state and didn't turn over official records until late last year, a former Justice Department official said last week that if Clinton signed that form, she probably gave a false statement and broke the law.But on Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters they are ""fairly certain she did not"" sign it.""We have reviewed Secretary Clinton's official personnel file and administrative files and do not have any record of her signing the OF109 [form],"" Psaki said.This admission comes after the department for days was unable to answer questions about whether Clinton signed the form.It also raises questions about whether Clinton, by not signing it, at least violated department policy.Psaki claimed Clinton did not violate any policy. Further, she said Tuesday that neither of Clinton's two immediate predecessors, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, signed such a statement either.She also said that different bureaus within the department had different rules relating to such statements that had the effect of making their completion optional by some employees.Shannen Coffin, a senior lawyer under the George W. Bush administration, first cited the form OF109 in questioning whether Clinton committed a violation by exclusively using personal email as secretary of state, and then not turning over those emails deemed work-related until after leaving the department.If she indeed signed the document, he told Fox News last week, ""there's no question [she broke the law].""And if Clinton did not sign that document, he added, ""why not?""The Associated Press contributed to this report.",Compose the article as a series of diary entries from the perspective of someone involved in the events.,"The news broke today that the State Department has no record of Hillary Clinton signing the ""separation"" form, which certifies that the signer has turned over all official documents upon leaving the department.

"Encouraged by a new poll giving him a double-digit lead in the state and eager to pivot to the general election, the Republican front-runner stressed the importance of Indiana's Tuesday GOP primary more than he or his top advisers have previously.""Indiana is so important and we have to win it,"" Trump said to a crowd of approximately 1,500 people packed into a theater here in Terre Haute, Indiana. ""If we win Indiana, it's over.""While also echoing his top advisers' comments that he can clinch the nomination without Indiana's 57-delegate prize, Trump urged Indiana Republicans to put him over the top -- a victory that would solidify Trump's increasingly clear path to winning the GOP nomination on the first ballot of the party's summer convention.Still, Trump didn't relent in his attacks against the Texas senator, whom Trump accused of being a liar. Trump also focused on Cruz's now non-existent path to winning the GOP nomination on the first ballot of the convention and mocked Cruz for announcing a running mate , former GOP candidate and businesswoman Carly Fiorina , under those circumstances. Cruz can only stake a claim to win his party's nomination if he can keep Trump from clinching the 1,237 delegates needed before the party's July convention.""I've been saying that!"" Trump exclaimed.Cruz was born in Canada to an American citizen mother -- his Cuban-born father later became a citizen. Trump has that used to claim Cruz is not a ""natural-born citizen"" and therefore ineligible to be president.The Cruz campaign did not respond to a request for comment.A win in Indiana Tuesday could depress Trump's rivals' hopes of keeping him from the 1,237 delegate mark necessary for a GOP nomination win. Trump suggested Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- who formed a pact with Cruz to stay out of Indiana and focus on other states -- might drop out if Trump triumphs in the Hoosier State.That, Trump said, would give him a chance to try and bring much-needed unity to a fractured Republican Party.""It's really important that we win because if we win -- you know, we want to raise money for the party and we want to raise money for the Senate races and the congressional races and do a lot of things instead of wasting our time with these people,"" Trump said.But Trump's ongoing primary battle didn't stop him on Sunday from knocking the former secretary of state repeatedly before a rowdy crowd of Hoosier supporters.Still, he pressed a plea for Indiana voters to deliver him a victory Tuesday that he said would empower him to focus on Clinton.""Please.

"Not all the claims in the vice presidential debate stand up to scrutiny. A look at some of them and how they compare with the facts:REPUBLICAN MIKE PENCE: ""The fact that under this past administration, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious.... Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same.""THE FACTS: As a share of the total U.S. economy, the national debt has gone up 35 percent; not a doubling.Still, the debt has ballooned to $19.6 trillion. This largely reflected efforts by the Obama administration to stop the Great Recession.Would Clinton similarly increase the debt? Not according to an analysis by the independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.The Clinton plan with its tax increases would increase the gross debt -- both privately and publicly held-- by $450 billion over 10 years. Mind you, that is on top of an $8.8 trillion increase already projected by the government under current law.As for Donald Trump, the committee says his tax-cut-heavy plan would increase the gross debt by $4.3 trillion --nearly 10 times more than Clinton's plan would do.DEMOCRAT TIM KAINE, on fighting the Islamic State: ""Donald Trump doesn't have a plan.""THE FACTS: Clinton also doesn't have a plan that is materially different than what President Barack Obama is already doing.She's described a three-part strategy that involves crushing IS ""on its home turf"" in the Middle East, disrupting its infrastructure on the ground and online, and protecting America and its allies. All are current elements of the Obama administration's strategy, so it's not clear what would change or if she would accelerate any portions of it.It's also the case that Trump has not laid out a clear plan.PENCE, calling Clinton the ""architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy,"" says the crisis in Syria was the result of a ""failed and weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead.""THE FACTS: Clinton, as secretary of state, actually pushed for increased U.S. intervention after Syrian President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons against rebels. But Obama is the commander in chief and nothing has swayed him thus far. Whatever her failings might be on foreign policy, it's a stretch to accuse her of helping to lead a weak policy on Syria.PENCE: ""We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal.""THE FACTS: The coal industry's woes don't come solely from onerous federal regulations. Pence omitted the effects of steep competition from cheap natural gas.A string of major coal companies have filed for bankruptcy in recent years, including Arch Coal, Alpha Natural Resources and Peabody Energy. Layoffs and cutbacks have spread economic suffering through coal country in the Appalachians and Wyoming's Powder River Basin. By contrast, these are boom times for natural gas extraction, mostly due to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.Still, the Obama administration has implemented rules that aren't making the coal industry's life any easier. Obama last year imposed a rule requiring coal-fired power plants to cut their carbon emissions as part of his effort to combat climate change. The rule has been suspended pending a legal challenge. Obama also has halted new coal leases on federal lands until it completes a comprehensive review.PENCE, saying he's proud that ""the state of Indiana has balanced budgets.""THE FACTS: True, but that's not exactly to his credit as governor of Indiana. A balanced budget is required by law, as it is in every state except Vermont.","Compose as a farewell speech from a key figure mentioned, reflecting on their journey.","It also includes some factual corrections and clarifications.**Here are the main points of the text:*** The national debt has increased by 35%, not doubled, under the Obama administration.* Clinton's tax plan would increase the gross debt by $450 billion over 10 years.* Trump's"

That bill, passed overwhelmingly by the House and supported by the Obama administration, required a 60-vote majority to proceed. It fell three votes short.The Senate then failed to advance a two-month extension of the expiring Patriot Act provision that would extend the NSA phone records program.

That gives lawmakers only a few hours to prevent the Patriot Act provisions from expiring.The majority leader stressed that it's a dangerous time to allow the law to expire, given the threats overseas and attempted attacks here, and urged the Senate to act ""responsibly"" to protect the country, Henry reports.The Justice Department has said the NSA would begin winding down collection of domestic phone records this week if the Senate failed to act, according to the Associated Press.","Convert the article into a detective's notebook, piecing together clues from the story.","The majority leader, Mitch McConnell, attempted to secure unanimous consent agreements on a number of measures aimed at preventing the program from lapsing, but was unsuccessful.**Key clues:*** The Senate first took up the House bill, which would end the NSA's bulk collection of domestic phone records.* The Senate failed to advance a two-month extension"

Further, she said Tuesday that neither of Clinton's two immediate predecessors, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, signed such a statement either.She also said that different bureaus within the department had different rules relating to such statements that had the effect of making their completion optional by some employees.Shannen Coffin, a senior lawyer under the George W. Bush administration, first cited the form OF109 in questioning whether Clinton committed a violation by exclusively using personal email as secretary of state, and then not turning over those emails deemed work-related until after leaving the department.If she indeed signed the document, he told Fox News last week, ""there's no question [she broke the law].""And if Clinton did not sign that document, he added, ""why not?""The Associated Press contributed to this report.","If the original text is opinionated, rewrite it to present the information in an unbiased, journalistic news format.","The State Department announced Tuesday that it has no record of Hillary Clinton signing a key form stating she turned over all official documents upon leaving the department.

"The water crisis in Flint, Mich., is just the tip of the iceberg – and if you think that it can’t happen in your community, you’re sadly mistaken. The aging water infrastructure in this country is deeply flawed. Many of the 150,000 public water systems that serve more than 300 million people are based on rusting, leaky pipes and decades-old plans that— if not corrected and replaced— will have devastating and long-lasting effects on our communities.The disaster in Flint, which began in 2014 when the city switched its water supply from Detroit’s system to the Flint River in a cost-saving measure, is likely brewing in many other communities. It is inconceivable to me that in the most developed nation on the planet, we have exposed families and young children to the poisonous effects of lead. And it is almost criminal to me that water supply officials were unaware that the water pumping through a large American city was endangering the community. That level of negligence is beyond comprehension.The dangerous, detrimental effects that lead can have on a developing brain and body are well-documented. In 1978, a largely successful campaign to remove lead from home paint products resulted in a new law, after it was found that small children could mistakenly eat paint chips and be exposed to lead poisoning. When it comes to levels of lead in water, no true amount is safe. However, in 1991 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established an action level for lead in public drinking water at 15 micrograms per liter, and required water supplies to routinely test household tap water to check lead levels.These laws and others were established to protect our citizens from both indirect and direct exposure to the harmful compound. A person can be directly exposed to lead by drinking contaminated water with unsafe levels, while indirect exposure can occur when a person inhales contaminated water particles through steam or vapors.Once lead enters the human body, the heavy metal attaches itself to cells that can begin to build up in bones or major organs like the liver or kidneys. It disrupts the normal cellular biology of the organ and can lead to chronic diseases. However, the most dangerous damage lead poisoning can inflict is on the brain, especially in young or unborn children. If lead is deposited in a developing fetal brain, it can disrupt the normal function and cause irreversible damage. The same can happen in young children whose brains are still maturing.The consequences can result in low IQ, severe delays in cognitive function, significant disruption in the memory center of the brain, learning disabilities and other neurological deficits. The devastating part of this diagnosis is that it is, for the most part, irreversible. Patients exposed to acute lead poisoning can be treated through chelation, which is a method used to filter out the lead. However, for children chronically exposed over a period of time, the damage cannot be undone.This makes the preventable crisis in Flint all the more devastating.I read that the Obama administration is planning to pick Dr. Nicole Lurie to act as a “czar” and fix the crisis in Flint, but I urge her to look further than just Michigan. Lurie and others must start to seriously evaluate other areas of America where the people are most susceptible to a disaster such as this. The government failed the city of Flint, it must act now to protect the rest of us.Dr. Manny Alvarez serves as Fox News Channel's senior managing health editor.

"With the provisions of the Patriot Act which allow the National Security Administration to collect data on Americans' phone calls newly expired, a new CNN/ORC poll finds 61% of Americans think the law ought to be renewed, including majorities across party lines, while 36% say it should not be reinstated.Republican leaders in the Senate are working to pass a bill to reinstate the law, after delays led by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky), whose presidential campaign has been noted for its appeal to independent voters and younger Republicans, and other surveillance opponents led to the law's expiration at 12:01 a.m. Monday. But Paul's stance on the issue is unlikely to bring him many fans within his own party.Support for renewal peaks among Republicans, 73% of whom back the law. Democrats largely agree, with 63% saying the law should be renewed. Independents are least apt to back it, with 55% saying renew it and 42% let it expire. Liberals, regardless of partisan affiliation, are most likely to say the law should not be renewed, 50% say so while 48% want to see it renewed.About half of Americans, 52%, say that if the law is not renewed, the risk of terrorism here in the U.S. would remain about the same. Still, a sizable 44% minority feel that without the law, the risk of terrorism will rise. Just 3% feel it would decrease.RELATED: Rand Paul vs. the GOP field on NSA The sense that the risk will rise is greatest among Republicans, 61% of whom say the risk of terrorism will climb if the NSA is unable to collect this data. Among Democrats and independents, less than half feel the risk of terrorism would increase if the program ended. The poll reveals a steep generational divide on the data collection program. Among those under age 35, just 25% say the risk of terrorism would increase without NSA data collection. That more than doubles to 60% among those age 65 or older. Those under age 35 are also split on whether the law should be renewed at all, 50% say it should be renewed while 49% say it should not. Among those age 35 or older, 65% back renewal of the law. President Barack Obama's reviews for handling government surveillance of U.S. citizens have worsened since June 2013 when the NSA data collection program was first revealed. Overall, 67% say they disapprove of the president's handling of government surveillance of U.S. citizens, up from 61% in June 2013. Much of that decline comes among his fellow partisans. In June 2013, 61% of Democrats approved of the president's handling of surveillance issues, that has fallen to 49% in the new poll. Obama fares better on his handling of terrorism generally, 45% approve and 51% disapprove. The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone May 29-31 among a random national sample of 1,025 adults.

"That may soon be possible thanks to a provision tacked onto this year's National Defense Authorization Act, which the House of Representatives is set to pass this week.The provision was added as an amendment during a late-night session at the end of last month during which the legislation authorizing the nation's military activities for 2016 was drafted.According to a white paper prepared for Congress by the Army opposing the amendment, the measure would allow the unregulated distribution of up to 100,000 Colt .45s, more formally known as .45-caliber semiautomatic M1911 handguns.The provision, added by Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), changes parts of federal rules that were meant to boost rifle skills in the country under a program dating back to Teddy Roosevelt. Under existing law, which was updated in 1996, the Department of Defense makes surplus military rifles available to the public through something known as the Civilian Marksmanship Program, which has a regional headquarters in Rogers' state.Rogers' amendment would change language in the law that specifies certain rifles allowed in the program to include the much broader category of ""firearms.""Although the marksmanship program aims to educate youth about safety and shooting, according to the military's white paper, ""There is a significant risk of approximately 100K semi-automatic handguns that are virtually untraceable, being released into commerce.""That's because although the amendment specifies that the weapons cannot be sold to people who are barred by law from having guns, the CMP sells guns over the Internet, and has no mechanism to verify who is making purchases. By law, the CMP ""can sell ... only to members of CMP affiliated clubs who are also U.S. citizens, over 18 years of age and who are legally eligible to purchase a firearm,"" according to eligibility requirements posted on its website. On top of that, although the CMP is allowed by law to sell guns across state lines, it is not covered by the Gun Control Act, and is not required to keep records tracking purchasers.The Army noted in its opposition that the Department of Justice has tracked an average of nearly 1,800 Colt .45s being used in crimes every year over the last decade, including a significant but unspecified number of those guns that were originally military surplus.A spokesman for Rep. Adam Smith (Wash.), the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said his boss agreed with the Army and would try to strip the amendment.""This provision, which the Army has said it does not want or need, could potentially put nearly 100,000 untraceable .45-caliber military-grade handguns on our streets,"" the spokesman, Michael Amato, said in an email. ""This provision is an unnecessary risk.""",Convert into a dialogue between two people with opposing views on the subject.,"**Rep. Mike Rogers:** ""This provision is a commonsense measure that will allow responsible gun owners to exercise their Second Amendment rights. The Civilian Marksmanship Program has been a successful program for many years, and it's a great way to teach young people about gun safety and responsibility.

"Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon said he will vote to support the Iran nuclear deal, a pledge that puts President Barack Obama only three votes short of protecting the pact in Congress.Merkley issued a statement Sunday calling the accord “the best available strategy to block Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.”Merkley’s support brings to 31 the number of senators publicly favoring the deal, which would ease economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on the country’s nuclear program.Barring defections, Obama needs three more votes from 13 Senate Democrats who have yet to declare their position, to sustain a likely veto of legislation aimed at killing the pact.If Obama can assemble 41 Senate votes by getting most of the remaining Democrats on board, the Senate may not vote on the agreement at all.The Republican-controlled Congress has until Sept. 17 to pass a resolution disapproving the deal reached in July between six world powers and Iran. Obama has pledged to veto that resolution if it gets to his desk.While Republicans have been united in opposing the deal, only two Democratic senators -- Charles Schumer of New York, the third-ranking Democrat in the chamber, and Robert Menendez of New Jersey -- have joined them so far.Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, plans to announce his decision on Tuesday. Among other Democrats yet to disclose a position are Maryland’s Ben Cardin and New Jersey’s Cory Booker.The only uncertain Senate Republican vote is that of Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who remains undecided and is expected to make her decision after Sept. 7.Merkley, in a statement on his website, pledged to vote for the deal even while pointing to “significant shortcomings” that he said the U.S. must address with “a massive intelligence program” and monitoring.Merkley said he was troubled that the deal allows Iran to import conventional arms after five years and ballistic missile technology after eight years, and sets no restrictions on how Iran can use money it reclaims when sanctions are lifted.But he rejected a proposal from deal opponents to try to renegotiate the accord for better terms.If the U.S. rejects the deal and Iran resumes its nuclear program, “the United States would be viewed by the international community as undermining a strong framework for peacefully blocking a potential Iranian bomb,” Merkley said.While the Republican-controlled House has enough votes to pass a resolution rejecting the deal, it’s unclear whether the Senate does.

"Ten months after the Supreme Court passed a landmark case on gay marriage, a backlash against the ruling is spreading across the country.Thirty-four states are considering new bills that would protect Christians from the threat of legal action because they object to gay marriage on religious grounds.It's shaping up to be a fierce debate as gay activists and people of faith battle for their rights to be protected.Business owners Dick and Betty Odgaards' story should serve as a warning of what happens when so-called religious freedom laws are not in place to protect people of faith.On August 3, 2013, a gay couple asked the Odgaards if they could rent their gallery in Iowa for a same-sex wedding.""They came in, and Dick was there, and he was the one who had to deliver the bad news to them,"" Betty recalled.The Odgaards refused, citing their Christian belief that marriage should be between one man and one woman.""I don't want to celebrate my sins. I don't want other people to celebrate my sins, nor do I want to participate in celebrating anybody else's sins,"" Richard said.The gay couple sued them for discrimination and after a two-year court battle, rather than celebrate gay marriages, the Christian couple paid the couple a fine and agreed to stop hosting weddings at the gallery.""It has been difficult. I won't lie,"" Betty acknowledged. ""It has been the hardest thing we've ever been through and I don't wish it upon anyone.""Their decision cost them dearly. After months of negative publicity, hate mail, death threats and loss of income, the Gortz Haus Gallery went out of business last year.""The ugly continues to come at us, but I wouldn't want to be anywhere else and we would do it all over again the same way because we are in the middle of God's will,"" Betty told CBN News.Since last summer's Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, more than 100 religious freedom bills have been proposed in 34 states to protect Christians and others from the threat of legal action because they object to gay marriage on religious grounds.Take for example the new law just passed in Mississippi.""The Mississippi law says if you believe marriage is the union of one man and one woman, that sex is reserved for marriage and that we are created male and female -- it doesn't say you have to believe those things -- but it says if you do believe those things, we are not going to penalize you if you act on those beliefs,"" explained Dr. Ryan Anderson, a senior fellow with the Washington, D.C-based Heritage Foundation.In Louisiana and Ohio, lawmakers are also proposing measures that protect pastors who refuse to perform same-sex marriages.Anderson said the accusation that these religious freedom laws are discriminatory against gays and lesbians just isn't true.""I think the basic argument here is that we are trying to protect pluralism, we're trying to protect diversity, we're promoting tolerance,"" he said.But some of the laws have been met with fierce opposition from businesses, activists and celebrities.For instance, North Carolina's governor was forced to roll back portions of a controversial new state law after several companies criticized the law and others threatened to stop their businesses in the state.""I think this just shows you that what's taking place is a form of cronyism, it's cultural cronyism,"" Anderson said. ""Big business is using their marketing freedom to deny little businesses and religious people their religious freedom.""What is clear though is that the backlash from last year's Supreme Court decision has brought religious freedom concerns to the forefront this spring.Many Americans believe that the battle over gay rights versus protecting people's religious convictions is just beginning.","Craft an infographic, visually summarizing the article's statistics and main points.",**The debate over gay marriage and religious freedom has sparked a wave of legislation across the country.**Key Statistics:*** **34 states** are considering new bills that would protect Christians from legal action due to their objection to gay marriage on religious grounds.* **More than 100 religious freedom bills** have been proposed in these states.* **Mississippi** has passed a law that protects religious freedom related to marriage.* **Louisiana
"The 62-38 vote to end debate on the bill, moving it toward a final vote, was a victory for Obama, who had linked with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, to push the bill despite opposition from Senate Democratic leaders.""This last vote was a major step forward on this important legislation,"" said Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Republican who sponsored the bill.The Senate is now set to vote on changes to the bill, including one that would force the Obama administration to use trade deals to crack down on countries that manipulate the value of their currencies to give their exports a price advantage in the United States — an amendment the White House opposes because it would add a huge new complication into trade negotiations.Even though Senate passage is ultimately now much more likely, the House could be tougher. There, tea party conservatives are linking up with liberals to form a broader populist opposition than what existed in the Senate.The measure would hand the President six years' worth of ""trade promotion authority"" — the power to submit trade deals to Congress for an up-or-down vote with limited debate and no amendments. It's considered crucial to finalizing the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive trade deal that serves as the economic underpinning of Obama's ""Asia pivot."" It would link 40% of the world's economy, including the United States, Japan, Australia, Canada and Mexico. The trade deal has launched an obscure commerce policy discussion into a fiery political battle that has positioned the President at odds with most of his party, particularly Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and driven a wedge between the Democratic presidential front-runner, Hillary Clinton, and her primary challengers. The Senate is also looking to dispense with the trade votes to move forward and take up bills to reform or reauthorize the Patriot Act, an issue that considers to deeply divide the Senate and Republicans on Capitol Hill. The House overwhelmingly passed the USA Freedom Act, a bipartisan bill to reform the Patriot Act and effectively end the National Security Agency's bulk collection of phone data on millions of Americans. And while that bill was the result of a compromise between reform advocates and House Republican leadership, the bill is facing tough opposition in the Senate from powerful Republicans like McConnell, though the majority leader has vowed to allow a vote on the reform measure. He is pushing a competing bill to reauthorize the expiring Patriot Act provisions without any reforms.","Conceive as a children's book story, simplifying complex ideas into engaging narratives.","The bill, which was linked with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, and Senator Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, would give the President six years' worth of ""trade promotion authority.""The bill is important because it would allow the President to negotiate trade deals with less resistance from Congress.

"WASHINGTON -- Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy (D) will sign an executive order on Monday barring state-funded travel to Indiana because of the state's new law that could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers for religious reasons.Malloy's move would make Connecticut the first state to boycott Indiana over its Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which Gov. Mike Pence (R) quietly signed into law last week. The law allows businesses in the state to cite religious beliefs as a legal defense. Opponents fear it offers legal protection for businesses to refuse service to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.Two cities, San Francisco and Seattle, have imposed similar bans in response to the law. Businesses have also retaliated. Angie's List is pulling a campus expansion project in Indianapolis, and the CEO of Salesforce, a $4 billion software corporation, announced plans to ""dramatically reduce our investment"" in the state because of the law.Twenty states have RFRA laws, but Indiana's law is substantially different. While other state RFRAs apply to disputes between a person and a government, Indiana's law goes further and applies to disputes between private citizens. That means, for example, a business owner could use the law to justify discrimination against customers who might otherwise be protected under law.The Indiana law could result in ""employers, landlords, small business owners, or corporations, taking the law into their own hands and acting in ways that violate generally applicable laws on the grounds that they have a religious justification for doing so,"" reads their letter. ""Members of the public will then be asked to bear the cost of their employer's, their landlord's, their local shopkeeper's, or a police officer's private religious beliefs.""That's in sharp contrast to states like Connecticut, which has an RFRA but one that pertains only to religious institutions, not private establishments. And unlike some other states, Connecticut also doesn't permit discrimination based on sexual orientation in any private establishment or institution.Before signing the order, he called the Indiana law ""disturbing and outright discriminatory,"" and said the National Collegiate Athletic Association should relocate its Final Four tournament from Indiana to another state. Those games are set to begin later this week.""I think that would be a wise choice for them to do if that's possible,"" said Malloy. ""I'll leave it up to them to make those decisions.""The NCAA president Mark Emmert has said he is ""surprised and disappointed"" by Indiana's law, and that he is waiting for some kind of clarification to the law, or an outright repeal, before deciding whether to keep holding sporting events in the state.Malloy said his executive order allows for any of the state's current contractual obligations with Indiana to play out, but said he doesn't plan to enter into any new ones.""Somebody's got to stand up to this kind of bigotry and I'm prepared to do it,"" he said.","Format as a series of tweets from an expert, offering insights and commentary.","The law, known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), allows businesses in Indiana to cite religious beliefs as a legal defense against providing service to certain individuals.

"Speaking from Hiroshima, the site of the first war-time atomic weapon detonation, President Obama on Friday called for the pursuit of ""a world without nuclear weapons.""Only a few days prior, his Department of Defense published new data revealing that the government Obama oversees -- a government which manages the second-largest nuclear stockpile in the world -- had dismantled fewer of its nuclear devices than in any year since at least 1980.Every year, the Department of Defense declassifies data on the size of the country's nuclear stockpile and the number of warheads dismantled. Its most recent data, released this week, shows that the U.S. stockpile numbered 4,571 at the end of 2015, about 15 percent of its size at its peak during the Cold War in 1967. The number of weapons dismantled was 109, the lowest figure since at least 1980.In 1945, the size of the stockpile matched the number of weapons deployed -- two. The biggest reductions came in the early 1990s during the administration of George H.W. Bush and, a decade later, during his son's. At the end of 2008, the stockpile numbered 5,273; over the course of Obama's two terms, it has dropped to 4,571.It is, of course, easier to reduce the size of a stockpile when it is much larger. As a fraction of the total weapon count, Obama has sliced the total by a bit more than one-tenth -- 13 percent. But the Federation of American Scientists is still critical of Obama's progress in this regard. That 13 percent is ""the smallest reduction of the stockpile achieved by any previous post-Cold War administration;"" the 109 dismantlings last year continues ""a trendline of fewer and fewer warheads dismantled"" under Obama. The FAS notes that there are reasons outside of the administration's control for the lower number last year -- but also that political pressure discourages a push for reduction.Why does the size of our stockpile matter? As data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows, the United States still controls about half of the weapons controlled by recognized nuclear states.","Transform the article into a how-to guide, providing practical advice based on the information presented.","**How to Reduce the Size of the U.S. Nuclear Stockpile**The U.S. government has a long history of dismantling nuclear weapons, and President Obama has continued this trend.

"MIAMI - Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio dropped out of the race for president Tuesday, ending his White House bid after a humbling loss in his home state to Donald Trump.""It is not God's plan that I be president in 2016 or maybe ever,"" the Florida senator told a crowd of supporters in Miami.While he didn't name Trump, Rubio warned against embracing his brand of divisive politics: ""I ask the American people, do not give into the fear, do not give into the frustration,"" he said.Rubio's decision was prompted by losses in all but three of the presidential nomination contests, but Florida's winner-take-all primary proved the most devastating. Only six years earlier, he was a tea party favorite who crushed the GOP's ""establishment"" candidate to win a seat in the U.S. Senate.But the political tables turned on him in the 2016 presidential race, where he was lambasted as mainstream in a year when voters cried out for an outsider.In the final week, he dedicated time and resources almost exclusively to the Sunshine State, urging voters to stop Trump from ""hijacking"" the Republican Party. He went so far as to tell his supporters in Ohio to vote for Buckeye State governor John Kasich since his chances were better to win there.Despite his intense rivalry with Trump, Rubio only indirectly criticized him during much of the campaign. He pivoted to an all-out assault on the businessman's character and ethics after a dismal Super Tuesday performance March 1, when he clinched only one of the 11 contests.In recent weeks, the attacks deviated from policy to personal. At one point, Rubio equated Trump's small hands with his manhood. But the strategy backfired with voters and donors and Rubio later said he regretted the attacks.Like other Republicans, Rubio had pledged to support the eventual GOP nominee. But, in recent days, he expressed having second thoughts. He told reporters Saturday that the chaos and divisiveness at Trump's rallies, including the one in Chicago canceled last week, had made it harder for him to view the front-runner as a viable candidate.The 44-year-old senator had seemed destined for the national spotlight. Time magazine placed him on its cover in early 2013, dubbing him the ""Republican Savior.""In under a decade, he had gone from West Miami commissioner to state legislator to Florida House Speaker. In 2010, he challenged a sitting governor for a U.S. Senate seat and won after starting more than 50 percentage points behind in the polls, catapulted by a wave of tea party supporters.He launched his presidential campaign at the Miami Freedom Tower, where tens of thousands of his fellow Cuban-Americans had been processed as refugees. He promised lower taxes, less regulation, tighter federal spending, modernized immigration laws, and the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare.At the time, Rubio's friend and one-time mentor, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, seemed his biggest hurdle to get to the Oval Office.Enter Trump. By mid-summer, he turned the Bush-Rubio rivalry into a telenovela without the sizzle. Bush dropped out after the Feb. 20 South Carolina primary.In the Iowa caucuses, Rubio came in a better-than-expected third place, nearly beating Trump for second. He then banked on a big showing in New Hampshire but a stunningly poor debate performance - in which he frequently repeated talking points and was called ""scripted"" by rival Chris Christie - led to a dismal fifth place.""Our disappointment tonight is not on you. It's on me,"" he told supporters that night.Rubio came in second in South Carolina and Nevada, but on March 1, Super Tuesday, he collected just one win in 11 contests.The final blow came two weeks later, at home.Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

"WASHINGTON -- The Senate advanced legislation Monday night to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, even though President Barack Obama has already said he would veto it.The Senate voted 63-32 to clear a procedural hurdle and begin debate on the bill. Ten Democrats and one independent, Angus King (Maine), voted with every Republican to move the bill forward. Those Democrats included Sens. Michael Bennet (Colo.), Tom Carper (Del.), Bob Casey (Pa.), Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), Joe Manchin (W.Va.), Claire McCaskill (Mo.), Jon Tester (Mont.), Tom Udall (N.M.) and Mark Warner (Va.). A final vote is expected later this week.Despite the strong vote, the Senate lacks the two-thirds majority vote needed to overcome a veto. The House passed the bill last week by a vote of 266 to 153 -- also shy of the 290 votes needed to clear a veto.Congressional action on Keystone comes after the Nebraska Supreme Court cleared the way last week for the proposed pipeline's route through the state. The Obama administration had been waiting for the Nebraska ruling to render its own decision on the pipeline, which is still forthcoming.White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Friday that the State Department is examining the court's decision as part of its process to evaluate whether the Keystone XL Pipeline project serves the national interest.""As we have made clear, we are going to let that process play out,"" Schultz said.

"The Hillary Clinton campaign, in an unusual late-afternoon conference call, touted an exclusive Fox News report on the origin of the FBI probe into the candidate’s server in a bid to argue it proves she did nothing wrong -- though a top government watchdog pushed back on the campaign's claims.The report by Fox News’ Catherine Herridge, for the first time, identified emails that helped kick-start the current investigation. The emails were from top Clinton advisers and had earlier been released to the Benghazi select committee.On the conference call Wednesday reacting to the report, top Clinton campaign aides said those emails were not marked classified at the time they were sent.However, despite the Clinton campaign’s claims, a spokeswoman for the intelligence community inspector general reiterated to Fox News that the information in the emails was in fact considered classified at the time it was sent.An aide to Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, also issued a statement defending the intelligence community's concern. ""Just because the State Department may not think information is or should be classified, it does not have the authority [to] make that decision if it received the information from another agency,"" a Grassley spokesperson said.Campaign Press Secretary Brian Fallon acknowledged Wednesday they have a disagreement on that point with the intelligence community inspector general. Clinton campaign officials said on the call that, at worst, this is a dispute between two agencies, as the State Department also maintains the emails were not classified.Fallon said the campaign previously did not know which emails originally had been flagged, and called the Fox News report a “watershed” moment in understanding what led to the review. Calling the report “fortuitous” and saying they have no reason to doubt its veracity, the aides also emphasized the emails were not written by Clinton herself.“We again would like to see the government agencies involved in this process to proceed as quickly as possible in conducting a review of the emails,” Fallon said. “We think it will vindicate all the points we made today on this whole matter.”The emails identified by Fox News as helping spur the referral both pertained to Benghazi.The first was forwarded by Clinton adviser Huma Abedin. The 2011 email forwards a warning about how then-deputy chief of mission Chris Stevens was ""considering departure from Benghazi"" amid deteriorating conditions in a nearby city. The email was mistakenly released by the State Department in full, and is now considered declassified.The second was sent by Clinton aide Jake Sullivan. The partly redacted November 2012 email detailed how Libyan police had arrested ""several people"" with potential connections to the terror attack.Abedin and Sullivan now work for the Clinton presidential campaignFox News understands those two emails were separate from four other emails that the inspector general flagged in July as containing classified information.A statement from the IG’s office last month, though, referenced one of the two emails, pointing to an “inadvertent release of classified national security information” by the State Department through its FOIA process. That statement also acknowledged the disagreement between the two agencies, saying the department denies the “classified character” of the information “despite a definitive determination from the IC Interagency FOIA Process.”Aside from that disagreement, the two emails also represent just a fraction of the hundreds of emails‎ that the IG and State Department have since flagged for containing potentially classified material.The Clinton campaign argued Wednesday that this whole experience speaks to the government’s tendency toward classification.“We think that this says more about the bent towards secrecy within some corners of the government. It says more about that than it does about Hillary Clinton’s email practices,” Fallon said.",Summarize the key points as if explaining to a curious ten yours old.,"The campaign claimed that the emails were not classified at the time they were sent.

"Texas Senator Ted Cruz (R) isn’t about to let the facts get in the way of his narrative, so instead of admitting that his party’s rhetorical tantrums about hoax videos may have contributed to Robert Louis Dear’s decision to shoot up a Planned Parenthood clinic on Friday, he blamed it on what conservatives would consider a most loathsome manticore: a “transgendered leftist activist.”On Sunday, Cruz said that any attempt to link Dear to conservatives’ mission to curtail a woman’s right to choose is merely “vicious rhetoric on the left blaming those who are pro-life.” He claimed that “the media promptly wants to blame [Dear] on the pro-life movement, when at this point there’s very little evidence to indicate that.” Cruz, you see, is very, very concerned about people who make commonsense accusations based on reports that Dear was mumbling about “baby parts” when he was arrested. Repeating the Republican talking points about Planned Parenthood constitutes, to his mind, “very little evidence.”Solid evidence, for Cruz, comes from the person who has been deemed The Stupidest Man On The Internet, who discovered that Dear was listed as “Female” on a voter registration form, meaning he is obviously, as Cruz identified him, a “transgendered leftist activist.”Cruz made that statement while attempting to take the high road, but he’s unfamiliar with such heights and it showed. “It’s also been reported that he was registered as an independent and a woman and transgendered leftist activist, if that’s what he is,” he said. “I don’t think it’s fair to blame on the rhetoric on the left. This is a murderer.” Apparently, he believed people would walk away from his statement thinking, “It’s big of Cruz not to blame leftist rhetoric for a man shooting up a Planned Parenthood clinic” — which says quite a bit about how intelligent he considers his audience.Moreover, given that the only evidence Cruz has that Dear was transgender is a single voter registration form in which he identifies both as “Female” and “UAF,” which stands for “unaffiliated,” it stands to reason that he believes it impossible for a transgender person to be affiliated with the conservative movement in general or the Republican Party in particular. While that may be true, it’s also telling about who he assumes can find a home in the conservative coalition. As ThinkProgress’ Zack Ford reported, no one who knew him believed he identified as a woman, and his ex-wife claimed that “he believed wholeheartedly in the Bible,” but that doesn’t constitute the kind of evidence a professional prevaricator like Cruz would consider worthy of mention. He should be commended, though, for his restraint in not arguing that Dear was simply a bank robber who took shelter in the Planned Parenthood clinic, another conservative canard that made the rounds this weekend.","Convert the article into a crossword puzzle, with clues derived from the content and themes.",**Crossword Puzzle:****Across:**1.

"Encouraged by a new poll giving him a double-digit lead in the state and eager to pivot to the general election, the Republican front-runner stressed the importance of Indiana's Tuesday GOP primary more than he or his top advisers have previously.""Indiana is so important and we have to win it,"" Trump said to a crowd of approximately 1,500 people packed into a theater here in Terre Haute, Indiana. ""If we win Indiana, it's over.""While also echoing his top advisers' comments that he can clinch the nomination without Indiana's 57-delegate prize, Trump urged Indiana Republicans to put him over the top -- a victory that would solidify Trump's increasingly clear path to winning the GOP nomination on the first ballot of the party's summer convention.Still, Trump didn't relent in his attacks against the Texas senator, whom Trump accused of being a liar. Trump also focused on Cruz's now non-existent path to winning the GOP nomination on the first ballot of the convention and mocked Cruz for announcing a running mate , former GOP candidate and businesswoman Carly Fiorina , under those circumstances. Cruz can only stake a claim to win his party's nomination if he can keep Trump from clinching the 1,237 delegates needed before the party's July convention.""I've been saying that!""

Trump suggested Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- who formed a pact with Cruz to stay out of Indiana and focus on other states -- might drop out if Trump triumphs in the Hoosier State.That, Trump said, would give him a chance to try and bring much-needed unity to a fractured Republican Party.""It's really important that we win because if we win -- you know, we want to raise money for the party and we want to raise money for the Senate races and the congressional races and do a lot of things instead of wasting our time with these people,"" Trump said.But Trump's ongoing primary battle didn't stop him on Sunday from knocking the former secretary of state repeatedly before a rowdy crowd of Hoosier supporters.Still, he pressed a plea for Indiana voters to deliver him a victory Tuesday that he said would empower him to focus on Clinton.""Please.

"It's hard not to like Joe Biden. I've seen him speak in person several times, and his love for people and politics is downright infectious. I'm sad he announced Wednesday he is not running for president, because he's fun and he would have lit up the campaign.But I think he made the right decision.The path to winning the Democratic nomination certainly wasn't clear, let alone easy, and it's better for Biden to end his career at the high point of the vice presidency rather than try for the presidency once again and fail. And while Biden seems genuinely to relish campaigning, campaigns are getting less and less fun by the day. The truth is that a Biden candidacy would have been enjoyable for voters (and the media). But it probably wouldn't have been very enjoyable for Biden.More substantively, a Biden candidacy might simply have muddied the otherwise helpfully clear waters between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.Take the first Democratic debate, where Clinton tried to argue that her plan for how to deal with the ills and excesses of Wall Street was ""more comprehensive"" and ""tougher"" than Sanders'. Sanders' response? ""Well, that's not true.""On this issue, Sanders is right. He is a lifelong economic populist, to the point where he's not afraid to criticize the structural failings of capitalism and change the underlying rules of the game to make sure the economy helps poor people and working families. Clinton, on the other hand, has certainly embraced some of the rhetoric of populism in her latest campaign. But the extent to which it courses through her bones -- let alone her policies -- is questionable. In the middle of this debate would have been Biden. The vice president has more populist street cred from the get-go, especially rhetorically. I don't think I've ever heard Biden speak without mentioning his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. More importantly, despite a lofty career since then, he's always managed to maintain a straight shooter, ""Regular Joe"" style. But on policies, he's more closely aligned with Clinton than Sanders. Biden voted in favor of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act , which repealed part of the Glass-Steagall Act, opening the door to banks to engage in the wild risk-taking that crashed the economy. Biden sided with big banks in making it harder for Americans to reduce their amount of student debt. And Biden supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal (as Clinton did for a while before recently changing her view ). With a little more than a year until the presidential election, it's essential for Democratic voters -- and Americans in general -- to see a debate in the primaries in which conventional centrist economic policy is exposed and evaluated in light of a viable, populist alternative. Clinton and Sanders are having that very real and important debate. ""Regular Joe,"" who repeatedly promotes centrist policies that most help the country's elite, would have unhelpfully complicated things. ""I can die a happy man never having been president of the United States of America,"" Biden once told a reporter. ""But it doesn't mean I won't run."" Now, apparently he won't run. And while we should be grateful for his public service up until now, his decision is also a public service -- because the Democratic primary will run better without him.","Compose as a series of motivational posters, each highlighting a key message or quote.","**Poster 1:****Quote:** ""I can die a happy man never having been president of the United States of America.""**Message:** Biden's decision to not run is a public service.**Poster 2:****Quote:** ""Well, that's not true.""**Message:** Sanders is right.

"Republican Donald Trump appears to have carved out a wider path to the White House as a number of states including Florida and Ohio are no longer considered likely wins for Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project released on Saturday.The project, which combines opinion polls with an analysis of voting patterns under different election scenarios, still shows Clinton would have the best chance of winning the presidency if the Nov. 8 election were held today. Yet Trump has caught up to her level of support in several states.Clinton now has an 83 percent chance of winning the election by an average of 47 votes in the Electoral College, the body that ultimately selects the president. In late August, the States of the Nation estimated that Clinton had a 95 percent chance of winning by an average of 108 electoral votes.Over the past few weeks, Clinton's lead in the national polls has slipped considerably. Polls tend to narrow as Election Day nears, and the Clinton campaign has struggled to overcome controversy about how she handled classified information while serving as secretary of state.A separate Reuters/Ipsos poll of likely voters showed an 8-point lead for Clinton has vanished since the last week of August.Clinton is still favored to win 17 states, including many with large, urban populations such as New York, New Jersey and California that heavily influence the outcome of the election. Trump would likely win 23 states, many of them with smaller populations.The number of states projected for Clinton has dropped over the past few weeks. Two of those states, Ohio and Florida, were considered likely wins for Clinton in late August. Now the candidates are about even in support. Five more states, including Michigan and North Carolina are also up for grabs.The sample size was insufficient to determine the outcome in Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska and the District of Columbia, though Alaska usually votes Republican and Washington D.C. for the Democratic Party candidate.The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project is driven by an online survey that gathers responses from about 15,000 people per week. Their responses are weighted according to the latest population estimates, and each respondent is ranked according to their likelihood to vote.Once the poll is complete, the project tallies the levels of support and estimated error for both candidates, and then runs multiple election simulations given their respective support.","Develop as a script for a 5-minute documentary, including narrator lines and interview quotes.","According to the project, which combines opinion polls with an analysis of voting patterns under different election scenarios, Clinton would still have the best chance of winning the presidency if the Nov. 8 election were held today.

"The Alabama Judicial Inquiry Commission charged Chief Justice Roy Moore, an outspoken opponent of same-sex unions, with violating the state's judicial ethics laws, an allegation that could potentially remove him from office, according to news website AL.com.The legality of gay marriage had been at the center of a national debate for years until the Supreme Court ruled in June that the U.S. Constitution provides same-sex couples the right to marry, handing a historic triumph to the American gay rights movement.Despite the ruling and a federal court ruling that made gay marriage legal in Alabama, Moore issued in January an administrative order to state probate judges, ordering them not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, according to court documents.""Chief Justice Moore flagrantly disregarded and abused his authority,"" the complaint said. ""Moore knowingly ordered [probate judges] to commit violations...knowingly subjecting them to potential prosecution and removal from office.""Moore said in a statement that the commission has no authority over administrative orders or the court's ability to prohibit probate judges from issuing same-sex marriage licenses.""We intend to fight this agenda vigorously and expect to prevail,"" he said.Moore wrote in his order that the U.S. Supreme Court ruling was at odds with a decision in March 2015 by the Alabama Supreme Court that instructed probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.The conflicting opinions had resulted in ""confusion and uncertainty,"" Moore said, with many probate judges issuing marriage licenses to gay couples while others refused to do so.Until the Alabama Supreme Court decides the matter, probate judges ""have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license,"" he said.The complaint said Moore's order ""was contrary to clear and determined law about which there is no confusion or unsettled question.""Moore, a Republican, has been a hero of conservative causes before.

"Not all the claims in the vice presidential debate stand up to scrutiny. A look at some of them and how they compare with the facts:REPUBLICAN MIKE PENCE: ""The fact that under this past administration, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious.... Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same.""THE FACTS: As a share of the total U.S. economy, the national debt has gone up 35 percent; not a doubling.Still, the debt has ballooned to $19.6 trillion. This largely reflected efforts by the Obama administration to stop the Great Recession.Would Clinton similarly increase the debt? Not according to an analysis by the independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.The Clinton plan with its tax increases would increase the gross debt -- both privately and publicly held-- by $450 billion over 10 years. Mind you, that is on top of an $8.8 trillion increase already projected by the government under current law.As for Donald Trump, the committee says his tax-cut-heavy plan would increase the gross debt by $4.3 trillion --nearly 10 times more than Clinton's plan would do.DEMOCRAT TIM KAINE, on fighting the Islamic State: ""Donald Trump doesn't have a plan.""THE FACTS: Clinton also doesn't have a plan that is materially different than what President Barack Obama is already doing.She's described a three-part strategy that involves crushing IS ""on its home turf"" in the Middle East, disrupting its infrastructure on the ground and online, and protecting America and its allies. All are current elements of the Obama administration's strategy, so it's not clear what would change or if she would accelerate any portions of it.It's also the case that Trump has not laid out a clear plan.PENCE, calling Clinton the ""architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy,"" says the crisis in Syria was the result of a ""failed and weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead.""THE FACTS: Clinton, as secretary of state, actually pushed for increased U.S. intervention after Syrian President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons against rebels. But Obama is the commander in chief and nothing has swayed him thus far. Whatever her failings might be on foreign policy, it's a stretch to accuse her of helping to lead a weak policy on Syria.PENCE: ""We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal.""THE FACTS: The coal industry's woes don't come solely from onerous federal regulations. Pence omitted the effects of steep competition from cheap natural gas.A string of major coal companies have filed for bankruptcy in recent years, including Arch Coal, Alpha Natural Resources and Peabody Energy. Layoffs and cutbacks have spread economic suffering through coal country in the Appalachians and Wyoming's Powder River Basin. By contrast, these are boom times for natural gas extraction, mostly due to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.Still, the Obama administration has implemented rules that aren't making the coal industry's life any easier. Obama last year imposed a rule requiring coal-fired power plants to cut their carbon emissions as part of his effort to combat climate change. The rule has been suspended pending a legal challenge. Obama also has halted new coal leases on federal lands until it completes a comprehensive review.PENCE, saying he's proud that ""the state of Indiana has balanced budgets.""THE FACTS: True, but that's not exactly to his credit as governor of Indiana. A balanced budget is required by law, as it is in every state except Vermont.",Rewrite the text to simplify complex ideas and summarize key points for a younger audience or readers unfamiliar with the topic.,"Not all of these claims are accurate.The national debt has increased by 35%, not doubled, under the Obama administration.

Conway responded: ""Here's what we do know: We know that -- as he said yesterday in Gettysburg, Jake -- he used to be an insider.

"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) came out as a vaccine choicer Tuesday, saying it should be up to parents to decide whether to inoculate their children against deadly diseases that could infect the rest of the population.His stance was looser than the one he took last year against Kaci Hickox, the nurse Christie forcibly quarantined over Ebola fears when she returned to the United States after helping patients in West Africa. There was never any evidence that Hickox had symptoms of Ebola, a far less contagious disease than the measles, which is currently spreading across the country due to parents who refuse to vaccinate their children.On Monday night, Hickox went on ""All In with Chris Hayes"" on MSNBC and blasted Christie for his vaccination comments.""I think this is a good example of Gov. Christie making some very ill-informed statements.

""I have worked in a measles outbreak in northern Nigeria before. We were seeing about 2,000 children a week with measles. It is a scary disease. I know that these families of these 100 people who have the disease now could tell you a little bit about what the disease looks like and how much misery it causes.

"Is It Time To Reconsider Lifetime Appointments To The Supreme Court?The unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia and the looming face-off between the White House and the Senate over his replacement have revived proposals that would limit the tenure of U.S. Supreme Court justices.Legal scholars from both political parties renewed a call Tuesday to reconsider how much time justices spend on the high court. Many of them cited, with disapproval, a bruising and protracted clash building between President Obama and the GOP-controlled Senate over when and how to fill Scalia's vacancy.""The point of life tenure is to keep justices insulated from politics,"" said George Washington University law professor Orin Kerr. ""That didn't quite pan out.""For years now, lawyers have been floating proposals that future high-court justices spend no more than 18 years at a time on the Supreme Court bench. The plan would space out appointments, so presidents would make appointments every two years, supporters said. That would bring regular turnover and fresh thinking to the court — and align with the longer life spans of Americans since the nation's founding, they argue.""It just sounds undemocratic,"" said Gabe Roth, executive director of an advocacy group called Fix the Court, about the lifetime court appointments. ""There's definitely concern about the justices being out of touch. There have been a number of cases with modern technology, whether it be smartphones or bulk data collection or different types of ways of getting TV over the airwaves or over the Internet.""Thomas Merrill, a law professor at Columbia University and a former deputy U.S. solicitor general (1987-1990), said he's been ""a little bit skeptical"" of the idea of term limits for Supreme Court justices. But, Merrill said, his thinking has evolved.""My current cautious endorsement of this is based on the perception that the whole issue of appointments to the Supreme Court has become incredibly contentious, partisan, political, almost to the point where the political system freezes up, as we're witnessing right now with the Scalia death,"" Merrill said. ""It would be a good thing not to have the type of Armageddon it looks like we're about to have.""Term-limit supporters point to a 2015 poll by Reuters/Ipsos, after high-profile rulings on Obama's health care legislation and same-sex marriage, that suggested two-thirds of respondents would support a 10-year limit on tenure on the Supreme Court.But actually changing the system could be remarkably difficult for a political system that's already near paralysis. Some lawyers said the change could be made by lawmakers, but others have concluded it would require amending the Constitution. To do that, the House and Senate would need to vote their support, and then three-quarters of the states would have to approve.

"After a week of nonstop criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike for comments many condemned as racially charged, Donald Trump claims to be altering his campaign to be a little more inclusive. While the presumptive G.O.P. has long promised to “make America great again,” Trump now says he’s adding two words to slogan to illustrate just how non-racist he really is.“You know, I have the theme ‘make America great again,’ and I've added a couple of things,” Trump announced to supporters at a campaign rally in Richmond, Virginia, on Friday night. “Right now I’m adding make America great again—I’m adding ‘for everyone,’ because it’s really going to be for everyone. It’s not going to be for a group of people, it’s going to be for everyone. It’s true.”The allegedly amended slogan, which has yet to appear on any official signage or Trump merchandise, comes after the presidential candidate spent the first half of June repeatedly denouncing Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge of Mexican heritage presiding over the Trump University class action lawsuit, as inherently biased against him. (Curiel was born in Indiana.) His comments were widely condemned by the Washington political establishment, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who suggested he may be an idiot, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who called Trump’s statement the “textbook definition of a racist comment.”Trump, who hasn’t apologized or taken back any of his comments, indicated on Friday that he realized his words have had a negative effect on his campaign and declared he is not a racist.“I am the least racist person.

"As Congress's vote on a resolution to disapprove the administration's nuclear deal draws ever nearer, the math for President Obama is looking better and better.The magic number of Senate supporters the president needs to ensure that the deal stands is 34. Currently, he has 30. So he needs to pick up just four more to preserve the agreement — and there are still 14 remaining undecided Democrats in the chamber, several of whom have already made positive comments about the deal. So Obama has a lot of options.And tellingly, after a month of intense criticism of the deal from the right and from pro-Israel groups, only two Senate Democrats have been swayed to oppose the deal so far: Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York and Bob Menendez of New Jersey. They'll be joined by, it appears, every single Senate Republican.But that wouldn't be enough to sink the deal. If opponents want to block the sanctions relief that's crucial to the agreement, they need to assemble a two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate that can override a promised veto from Obama. And that's impossible to reach without a lot of Democratic votes, as I wrote in July:Deal opponents once hoped that the agreement would become politically toxic, leading to many Democratic defections. But that hasn't happened. Instead, the key swing votes — including some of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate, like Claire McCaskill and Joe Donnelly — have been won over by the administration.The state of play in the House is tougher for outsiders to gauge, but opponents appear to be well short of the 44 Democratic opponents they need there — just 14 Democrats have said they'll vote to kill the deal, according to the Hill. Again, the deal's opponents would need a veto-proof majority in both the Senate and the House to keep the sanctions in place.According to a Friday report from Eli Lake and Josh Rogin of Bloomberg View, deal opponents have already resigned themselves to losing the vote eventually. Furthermore, they write, ""Many Republicans now acknowledge in private that they were handed both a political and a policy defeat on the nuclear deal.""Now that the deal looks so likely to be upheld, the new question is whether Democrats can save President Obama from having to veto it in the first place.There wouldn't be any policy stakes here — achieving this would simply save the president from the embarrassment of Congress passing a resolution condemning his administration's foreign policy.For that to happen, 41 Senate Democrats would have to vote to filibuster the GOP's planned disapproval resolution — meaning Obama would need to win over 11 of the remaining 14 undecided Democrats in the chamber. That's a tall order, but given that only two Democratic senators have opposed the deal so far, it doesn't seem completely out of the question.The vote will likely take place in mid-September. But if you want to keep track yourself beforehand, here are the remaining undecided Democratic senators. Again, the administration needs to win four of their votes to uphold the deal, and 11 for a filibuster that would make a veto unnecessary:","Imagine it as a conference talk abstract, summarizing the main ideas and questions raised.","The main points include:* The current number of Senate supporters for the deal is 30, and the president needs 34 to ensure its passage.* There are still 14 undecided Democrats, and several of them have already made positive comments about the deal.* Two Senate Democrats have already announced their opposition"
"As the Democratic presidential contest reaches the third state, what began as a coronation is now an exciting dead heat. Yet by one measure, Bernie Sanders is ­already a clear winner.Regardless of whether the senator from Vermont captures the actual nomination, he has won the future of the Democratic Party.Sanders is demolishing the last remnants of the old order, as represented by Hillary Clinton and her split-the-difference triangulation. It is Sanders, not she, who is the true heir of the radical politics of Barack Obama.Calling a paradigm shift is like forecasting a recession — predict it often enough and you’ll eventually be right. Yet the developments unfolding before our eyes suggest the Democratic Party is undergoing a massive change. And a 74-year-old socialist is the architect.A major piece of evidence is the enormous youth vote he attracts. In Iowa and New Hampshire, he beat Clinton by about 70 points — 84 percent to 15 percent — among voters under age 30. And despite the nasty demands by Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem that women must support Clinton, Sanders got 82 percent of the young female vote.By contrast, Obama in the 2008 primaries typically beat Clinton among young people by about 20 points.

"Not all the claims in the vice presidential debate stand up to scrutiny. A look at some of them and how they compare with the facts:REPUBLICAN MIKE PENCE: ""The fact that under this past administration, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious.... Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same.""THE FACTS: As a share of the total U.S. economy, the national debt has gone up 35 percent; not a doubling.Still, the debt has ballooned to $19.6 trillion. This largely reflected efforts by the Obama administration to stop the Great Recession.Would Clinton similarly increase the debt? Not according to an analysis by the independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.The Clinton plan with its tax increases would increase the gross debt -- both privately and publicly held-- by $450 billion over 10 years. Mind you, that is on top of an $8.8 trillion increase already projected by the government under current law.As for Donald Trump, the committee says his tax-cut-heavy plan would increase the gross debt by $4.3 trillion --nearly 10 times more than Clinton's plan would do.DEMOCRAT TIM KAINE, on fighting the Islamic State: ""Donald Trump doesn't have a plan.""THE FACTS: Clinton also doesn't have a plan that is materially different than what President Barack Obama is already doing.She's described a three-part strategy that involves crushing IS ""on its home turf"" in the Middle East, disrupting its infrastructure on the ground and online, and protecting America and its allies. All are current elements of the Obama administration's strategy, so it's not clear what would change or if she would accelerate any portions of it.It's also the case that Trump has not laid out a clear plan.PENCE, calling Clinton the ""architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy,"" says the crisis in Syria was the result of a ""failed and weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead.""THE FACTS: Clinton, as secretary of state, actually pushed for increased U.S. intervention after Syrian President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons against rebels. But Obama is the commander in chief and nothing has swayed him thus far. Whatever her failings might be on foreign policy, it's a stretch to accuse her of helping to lead a weak policy on Syria.PENCE: ""We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal.""THE FACTS: The coal industry's woes don't come solely from onerous federal regulations. Pence omitted the effects of steep competition from cheap natural gas.A string of major coal companies have filed for bankruptcy in recent years, including Arch Coal, Alpha Natural Resources and Peabody Energy. Layoffs and cutbacks have spread economic suffering through coal country in the Appalachians and Wyoming's Powder River Basin. By contrast, these are boom times for natural gas extraction, mostly due to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.Still, the Obama administration has implemented rules that aren't making the coal industry's life any easier. Obama last year imposed a rule requiring coal-fired power plants to cut their carbon emissions as part of his effort to combat climate change. The rule has been suspended pending a legal challenge. Obama also has halted new coal leases on federal lands until it completes a comprehensive review.PENCE, saying he's proud that ""the state of Indiana has balanced budgets.""THE FACTS: True, but that's not exactly to his credit as governor of Indiana. A balanced budget is required by law, as it is in every state except Vermont.",Compose the article as a series of diary entries from the perspective of someone involved in the events.,"Pence's opening salvo about the national debt was met with a healthy dose of skepticism. While it's true that the debt has increased significantly under the Obama administration, the claim of a doubling is a gross exaggeration. The debt has gone up by 35%, not doubled. Still, the ballooning debt is"
"WASHINGTON -- Leaders from more than 70 cities and counties, some going against their states, joined a legal brief filed Monday asking an appeals court to allow President Barack Obama's deportation relief policies to move forward.""Continuing to delay implementation of the president’s executive action on immigration hurts our economy and puts families at risk,"" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), who spearheaded the effort with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) as part of Cities United for Immigration Action, said in a statement.""Cities are where immigrants live, and cities are where the president's executive action will be successfully implemented,"" he continued. ""Our cities are united, and we will fight for the immigration reform this nation needs and deserves -- whether in the courtroom, in Congress, or in our communities. Make no mistake about it: our voices will be heard.""Under the policies Obama announced in November, as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants with longstanding ties to the U.S. may be able to stay and work temporarily.Twenty-six states, led by Texas, filed the lawsuit, arguing the relief programs would cause them harm and violate the Constitution. They've won support from some Republican members of Congress and governors.But 14 states and the District of Columbia, including some led by Republicans, filed an amicus brief, saying the programs should be allowed to move forward.Garcetti and de Blasio spearheaded a similar brief in January and received about 30 signatures. The latest brief is backed by mayors, county executives and governments from 73 cities and counties in 27 states. The National League of Cities and the U.S. Conference of Mayors also have joined the brief. The cities and counties are home to 43 million people, according to organizers of the brief.Some cities signing onto the brief are in states that joined the lawsuit against the president's executive actions. Houston, the most populous city in Texas, is part of the cities' and counties' brief, as is the state capital, Austin. Cities and counties in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Arizona, Ohio, Indiana, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Florida and Utah also signed on, even though their states are suing over the executive actions.The brief argues the executive actions would be good for public safety and the economy in their cities and counties, and would help immigrants integrate and keep families together. The delay in implementing Obama's orders, the brief argues, ""harms their cities and counties and all residents thereof by forestalling the critical benefits of that action.""The Obama administration is seeking a ruling to allow the programs to move forward. The Justice Department filed an appeal last week asking the court to lift the injunction.UPDATE: 3:45 p.m. -- Nearly every House Democrat -- 181 of them -- signed on to another amicus brief filed on Monday asking the appeals court to lift the preliminary injunction on Obama's immigration policies.The House Democrats' amicus brief says that they ""well understand the importance of ensuring that the executive does not exceed its constitutional or statutory authority."" But it goes on to say that the lawmakers understand the executive has the authority to use its discretion in enforcing the law.""The broad discretionary authority to set removal policies and priorities is both explicit and implicit in the Nation’s immigration laws and has been exercised also by prior Administrations of both parties in ways consistent with the Secretary’s actions,"" the brief states, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson.","Reframe the text as a fitness or self-help guide, drawing lessons or advice from the story.","It also emphasizes the benefits of implementing policies that promote inclusivity and economic growth.**Lessons:****1.

"The family of Michael Brown will file a civil lawsuit against the city of Ferguson, Missouri, and former Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, an attorney for the family announced Thursday.The news comes just one day after the U.S. Department of Justice officially announced its decision not to file federal charges against Wilson for fatally shooting Brown last July.In a press conference, family attorney Anthony Gray expressed the family’s disappointment in the Justice Department’s decision and announced the next legal actions they plan to take.“We are officially formulating a civil case that we anticipate will be filed very shortly on behalf of the family,” Gray said. “We plan to demonstrate in a court of law that Wilson’s choice to use deadly force was unreasonable and unnecessary.”Brown's parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr., attended the conference but did not make any comments. However, their frustration with the department's decision is widely shared by many local officials, residents and protesters -- some of whom took to the streets Wednesday evening to demonstrate their outrage.The criticism was further fueled by a scathing report released by the Justice Department, also on Wednesday. The report revealed that the city of Ferguson had engaged in unconstitutional patrolling practices that routinely discriminated against African-Americans. It also disclosed emails proving racial bias on behalf of Ferguson police officials.""[It] really just confirms what many of us already knew and what has been experienced by many African-Americans here in the St. Louis region for quite some time,"" St. Louis Alderman Antonio French told HuffPost Live on Wednesday, referring to the report.""Some of the specific details were shocking, [but] there's a culture that's been allowed to fester in Ferguson and one that's really been experienced by African-Americans for years and boiled over last year,"" French continued.Attorneys for the Brown family say they hope some level of accountability can be reached through the civil case. Meanwhile, French has taken the lead in calling for the resignation of the chief of the Ferguson Police Department.“I think some of the specific details outlined in this Department of Justice report really make it impossible for him to stay there,” he said. “When you have the culture that exists with these racist emails ... the stats alone suggest he needs to go.""","Transform the text into a trivia quiz, testing knowledge on facts or details mentioned in the story.",**Trivia Quiz:**1.

"Two women with an interest in violent jihad were arrested in Queens, New York, Thursday morning as part of an FBI sting, after allegedly plotting to create explosive devices to use in a terrorist attack in the United States.Noelle Velentzas, 28, and Asia Siddiqui, 31, had allegedly taken several steps toward constructing an explosive device and discussed their activities with an undercover officer, according to court documents. They had not yet identified a target for their planned attack, federal authorities said. The defendants are U.S. citizens who live in Queens and were roommates until recently.During regular meetings between the two women and the undercover agent, both women espoused jihadist beliefs and praised past terrorist attacks in the United States. Velentzas allegedly showed the officer her cell phone, which had a background image of Osama bin Laden holding an AK-47. Siddiqui once said that Velentzas had been obsessed with pressure cookers since the Boston Marathon bombings, and Velentzas joked about how she planned to cook ""food"" in a pressure cooker she had recently purchased.It appears Velentzas eventually became suspicious of the undercover agent's identity, allegedly using her phone in November and December to access webpages with titles like ""Learning the Identity of a Confidential Informant,"" ""How to Spot Undercover Police,"" ""Is S/he an Informant?"" She also researched how to detect bugs.Yet she and Siddiqui continued to meet with the agent in the months that followed. Siddiqui purchased several propane tanks and stored them in her basement, and discussed them during the meetings. ""I got everything up in this joint, I already told you. If you guys... once we learn... I got everything up in this joint,"" she allegedly said. ""Yo, she got everything. This is like the Home Depot,"" the undercover agent responded.Velentzas then asked Siddiqui why she hadn't told them that she had purchased the tanks, but Siddiqui insisted she had. ""She's the master of not telling you shit that's really important,"" Velentzas said, later telling the undercover agent that they had to ""keep it a hundred"" so they could trust one another.""Cause how could you have a... have a open conversation about some shit that is uhm... federal-time worthy shit and the person... you know... is... half-ass in communication?"" Velentzas said. ""I""m gonna die for your ass and you don't communicate?""Federal authorities apparently have been aware of the women for a number of years. Velentzas ""expressed violent jihadist ideology and an interest in terrorism"" in meetings with the undercover agent back in 2013, and said that being a martyr guarantees entrance into heaven. Siddiqui allegedly wrote a poem in 2009 for a magazine called Jihad Recollections, which was a predecessor to the al-Qaeda publication Inspire, and sent a letter to a man arrested for trying to detonate a bomb during a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon, in 2010. She had repeated contact with members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, according to court documents.","Adapt the article to emphasize its relevance and impact on the global stage, highlighting international implications.","The recent arrest of two women in Queens, New York, as part of an FBI sting operation highlights the global implications of violent extremism and the potential for terrorist attacks on the United States.

"President Obama has long been a friend of organized labor, wholeheartedly supported by unions that helped boost him to victory in both his presidential campaigns.But increasingly, there now is a divide between unions in the public and private sector when it comes to supporting him.According to James Sherk, a labor policy analyst with the Heritage Foundation, government employee unions want ""bigger and more expensive government,"" in contrast to private sector unions.Sherk added those private groups are ""pushing back"" and speaking out more publicly about things like the Keystone XL Pipeline, which they believe will benefit their members. That has put them on a collision course with Obama, who last summer proclaimed, ""We should do everything we can to strengthen unions in this country.""""The president's insistence on vetoing this pipeline is directly taking away income from these union members, and they, understandably, don't like it,"" Sherk said.Congress has passed a measure to expedite the Keystone project, although Obama has vowed to veto it. Just days ago, Sean McGarvey, president of North America's Building Trades Unions, made a direct appeal.""We urge the president of the United States to put our men and women back to work across the length of this pipeline as soon as possible,"" McGarvey said, adding, ""We urge the president to sign the bill.""Union leaders also have a long-standing beef with the administration over the Affordable Care Act's enormous tax on so-called Cadillac health insurance plans.The plans offer high dollar benefits and are used as a recruiting tool.Although the tax doesn't kick in for several more years, as far back as 2013 union leaders were making public pleas to Democratic lawmakers. In a letter written in July of that year, union officials, including James Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, urged congressional Democrats to drop the tax saying, ""We voted for you.We have a problem; you need to fix it.""Analysts say the issue may present an opportunity for GOP leaders to build some good will with unions. Just days ago, Rep. Frank Guinta, R-N.H., introduced a measure he's calling ""Ax the Tax.""A similar measure didn't get far in the Senate last year, but may have a better chance with the GOP now in control of both the House and Senate.",Imagine as a behind-the-scenes look at the making of a documentary on the topic.,"Here is the rewritten text with some minor changes to improve clarity and flow:President Obama has long been a supporter of organized labor, enjoying the backing of unions that played a pivotal role in his victories in both presidential campaigns.

"MIAMI - Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio dropped out of the race for president Tuesday, ending his White House bid after a humbling loss in his home state to Donald Trump.""It is not God's plan that I be president in 2016 or maybe ever,"" the Florida senator told a crowd of supporters in Miami.While he didn't name Trump, Rubio warned against embracing his brand of divisive politics: ""I ask the American people, do not give into the fear, do not give into the frustration,"" he said.Rubio's decision was prompted by losses in all but three of the presidential nomination contests, but Florida's winner-take-all primary proved the most devastating. Only six years earlier, he was a tea party favorite who crushed the GOP's ""establishment"" candidate to win a seat in the U.S. Senate.But the political tables turned on him in the 2016 presidential race, where he was lambasted as mainstream in a year when voters cried out for an outsider.In the final week, he dedicated time and resources almost exclusively to the Sunshine State, urging voters to stop Trump from ""hijacking"" the Republican Party. He went so far as to tell his supporters in Ohio to vote for Buckeye State governor John Kasich since his chances were better to win there.Despite his intense rivalry with Trump, Rubio only indirectly criticized him during much of the campaign. He pivoted to an all-out assault on the businessman's character and ethics after a dismal Super Tuesday performance March 1, when he clinched only one of the 11 contests.In recent weeks, the attacks deviated from policy to personal. At one point, Rubio equated Trump's small hands with his manhood. But the strategy backfired with voters and donors and Rubio later said he regretted the attacks.Like other Republicans, Rubio had pledged to support the eventual GOP nominee. But, in recent days, he expressed having second thoughts. He told reporters Saturday that the chaos and divisiveness at Trump's rallies, including the one in Chicago canceled last week, had made it harder for him to view the front-runner as a viable candidate.The 44-year-old senator had seemed destined for the national spotlight. Time magazine placed him on its cover in early 2013, dubbing him the ""Republican Savior.""In under a decade, he had gone from West Miami commissioner to state legislator to Florida House Speaker. In 2010, he challenged a sitting governor for a U.S. Senate seat and won after starting more than 50 percentage points behind in the polls, catapulted by a wave of tea party supporters.He launched his presidential campaign at the Miami Freedom Tower, where tens of thousands of his fellow Cuban-Americans had been processed as refugees. He promised lower taxes, less regulation, tighter federal spending, modernized immigration laws, and the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare.At the time, Rubio's friend and one-time mentor, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, seemed his biggest hurdle to get to the Oval Office.Enter Trump. By mid-summer, he turned the Bush-Rubio rivalry into a telenovela without the sizzle. Bush dropped out after the Feb. 20 South Carolina primary.In the Iowa caucuses, Rubio came in a better-than-expected third place, nearly beating Trump for second. He then banked on a big showing in New Hampshire but a stunningly poor debate performance - in which he frequently repeated talking points and was called ""scripted"" by rival Chris Christie - led to a dismal fifth place.""Our disappointment tonight is not on you. It's on me,"" he told supporters that night.Rubio came in second in South Carolina and Nevada, but on March 1, Super Tuesday, he collected just one win in 11 contests.The final blow came two weeks later, at home.Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

"The Republican Party has put itself in an impossible position. For months they’ve told us, over and over and over again, how unstable Trump is, how unfit for office he is. They’ve told us he’s a “con artist,” a “clown,” a “bigot.” Now that he’s decimated their party, now that’s he toppled every hackneyed candidate he’s faced, they’re forced to perform an about-face and endorse him as their nominee for president.It won’t work. And no one will buy it.Hillary Clinton’s campaign has already done the easy work of compiling the statements made by Republicans about Trump. The result, predictably, is brutal. In less than 90 seconds, we hear – mostly from other Republican presidential candidates – why Trump is a menace who must be stopped. Here’s a few highlights:“This is an individual who mocked a disable reporter, who attributed a reporter’s question to her menstrual cycle…” – Mitt Romney“The most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency.” – Marco Rubio“The man who only feels big when he’s trying to make other people feel small” – Carly Fiorina“The man is utterly amoral…a narcissist at a level I don’t this country has ever seen.” – Ted Cruz“He’s a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot…This guy is so unfit to be commander-in-chief” – Lindsey GrahamSome party elders will have the dignity to follow their conscience and hold to their convictions. Both George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush, for instance, informed The Hill that they do “not plan to participate in or comment on” the presidential race. Neither Bush attended the previous convention, but the decision not to comment at all is revealing. It says, as clearly as possible, “We can’t support Donald Trump for president.”Others, like South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who accused Trump of cynically exploiting an angsty public during her response to the Obama’s State of the Union address, are already falling into line. “I have great respect for the will of the people,” she told The Charleston Post and Courier, “and as I have always said, I will support the Republican nominee for president.” She quickly added, however, that she’s “not interested in serving as vice president.”And there will be many Republicans, like Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and former Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, who know Trump is cartoonishly unqualified but nevertheless support his candidacy. From a New York Times report this morning: “Senator Kelly Ayotte of New New Hampshire, who is in a tough re-election race, signaled that she would ‘support’ Mr. Trump but not ‘endorse’ him, as a spokeswoman put it, a rhetorical contortion that other Republicans repeated privately. Representative Raul R. Labrador of Idaho, a staunch conservative, said he would support Mr. Trump but derided him for ‘not knowing much about the Constitution or politics.’ Former Gov. Bob Martinez of Florida, who retains a strong network of donors, said he would raise money for Mr. Trump but was unsure about his proposals, like temporarily banning foreign Muslims from entering the United States.” This is what happens when politicians put re-election or party over the moral imperative to do right by the country. You can’t say, in good faith, that Trump doesn’t know anything “about the Constitution or politics” but that you support him nonetheless. This is the presidency, after all – it’s rather important that the candidate know such things. Nor is there any room to equivocate about Trump’s proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the country – it’s both wrong and unconstitutional. Republicans let this monster into their house. He’s their problem. They have a responsibility to do what’s right – the stakes are too high to do otherwise. If they choose blind fidelity to the party over their obligation to the country, they’ve lost the right to call themselves public servants.","Convert the article into a travelogue, describing places, cultures, and experiences mentioned in the story.","The Republican Party has put itself in an impossible position.

The Dow and Nasdaq also turned up for the year so far.The advance was broad, with the S&P materials, energy and technology sectors each rising more than 2 percent, leading the day's gains.Though slightly above expectations, initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped from the prior week, pointing to a firming labor market ahead of Friday's key monthly payrolls report.""We're at the point where the jobs reports have been coming in consistently in the 200,000 or 200,000-plus range. I think that just keeps the Fed on track for everything we're expecting,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.Also boosting sentiment, continued weak euro zone data has been lifting optimism that the European Central Bank will take more aggressive action.U.S. crude oil, whose free-fall was among the catalysts for the recent selloff in stocks, gained for a second day, settling at $48.79 per barrel. The S&P energy index rose 2.2 percent.Signs that oil prices may be stabilizing have boosted investor sentiment, although market analysts were still not ready to say prices had found a floor.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 323.35 points, or 1.84 percent, to 17,907.87, the S&P 500 gained 36.24 points, or 1.79 percent, to 2,062.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 85.72 points, or 1.84 percent, to 4,736.19.The S&P 500's two-day gains were its biggest since the Dec. 17-18 Federal Reserve-fueled rally of 4.5 percent. Minutes from that December Fed meeting released Wednesday reassured investors the central bank was in no hurry to start raising interest rates.The S&P also snapped back above its 50-day average, a technical support level it fell below on Monday.""Weak hands are being forced to chase. There's a fear of missing out on the rally,"" O'Rourke said.About 7.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 6.7 billion average for the last five sessions, according to BATS Global Markets.Biotechs were among the most active shares.

"Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi has resigned under pressure from Shiite rebels who seized the capital in September and have confined the embattled leader to his home for the past two days.Presidential officials said Hadi resigned after being pressured to make concessions to the rebels, known as Houthis. He had earlier pledged political concessions in return for the rebels withdrawing from his house and the nearby presidential palace, but Houthi fighters remained deployed around both buildings throughout the day.Military officials close to the president, who like the other officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters, said Hadi resigned after the Houthis pressured him to give a televised speech to calm the streets.State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Thursday that the U.S. is assessing and seeking confirmation of the report.""We are seeking a peaceful transition,"" she said.The Yemeni government also submitted its resignation Thursday.Prime Minister Khaled Bahah's resignation came as the U.N. envoy to the Arab world's poorest country met with representatives from the rebels, known as Houthis and other political factions to try to implement a deal reached Wednesday to end the crisis.Under the agreement, the group's militias were to withdraw from the presidential palace and key areas of the capital they have overrun in recent days in return for political concessions.It remains unclear who really controls the country.Twenty-four hours after signing the deal, heavily armed Shiite rebels remained stationed outside Hadi's house and the presidential palace.Bahah's technocratic government was formed in November as part of a United Nations-brokered peace deal after the Houthis overran the capital in September.Bahah, a political independent, posted his resignation on his official Facebook page, saying he had held office in ""very complicated circumstances."" He says he resigned in order to ""avoid being dragged into an abyss of unconstructive policies based on no law.""""We don't want to be a party to what is happening or will happen,"" he added.In an attempt to end the logjam, U.N. Envoy Jamal Benomar arrived to the country and held a meeting with Houthis and other political factions to push for implementation of the deal.In a brief press conference before the meeting, Benomar told reporters that the deal -- in essence an activation of the previous UN-brokered agreement struck in September when Houthis overran the capital -- is ""the only solution for Yemen.""Yemen's emerging power vacuum has raised fears that the country's dangerous Al Qaeda branch, which claimed the recent attack on a French satirical weekly, will only grow more powerful and popular as the nation slides toward fragmentation and the conflict takes on an increasingly sectarian tone. The Shiite Houthis and the Sunni terror group are sworn enemies.While the capital was free of violence, clashes did erupt southeast of Sanaa between Houthi gunmen and local tribesman. Tribal leaders said two tribesmen and four gunmen allied with Houthi rebels were killed in Khawlan-Watadah, 30 miles from Sanaa.The violence appeared to subside by midday, but a serious flare-up in the region lying along the road to Marib province, an oil-rich area in central Yemen and a haven for Al Qaeda fighters, could torpedo peace efforts. At the entrance of Marib itself, clashes also erupted between Houthis and local tribesmen over new checkpoints erected by tribal fighters.The Associated Press contributed to this report.","Rewrite the article from an alternative perspective, such as from the viewpoint of a person mentioned in the story or from a neutral observer's perspective.","The Yemeni crisis has been a tumultuous one, and it's unfolding in a way that is both terrifying and heartbreaking.

"Freddie Gray, whose death triggered Monday’s rioting in Baltimore, may have intentionally tried to injure himself in a police van, according to another prisoner in the vehicle, the Washington Post reported late Wednesday night.The Post said the unidentified prisoner, who was separated from Gray by a metal partition and could not see him, reportedly said he heard Gray “banging himself against the walls” and believed he “was intentionally trying to injure himself.The prisoner’s statements were contained in an investigative document obtained by the paper, which said it was unclear if there was any additional information to support the theory.Gray, who is black, was arrested April 12 after he ran from police. Officers held him down, handcuffed him and loaded him into the police van. While inside, he became irate and leg cuffs were put on him, police had said. At some point, he suffered a severe spinal injury and was unconscious when the van arrived at a police station.Authorities have not explained how or when Gray’s spine was injured. He died April 19.The death of Gray sparked riots earlier this week in Baltimore as protests turned violent resulting into major property damage throughout the city and around 200 arrestsTuesday, the city started to enforce a curfew starting at 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. More than 3,000 National Guardsmen and law enforcement officers were called into the city to make sure no more violence took place in the city. Baltimore stayed quiet throughout the night Wednesday as well.Baltimore mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake has also come under fire after a senior law enforcement told Fox News Wednesday that she ordered police to stand down.The source, who is involved in the enforcement efforts, confirmed to Fox News there was a direct order from the mayor to her police chief Monday night, effectively tying the hands of officers as they were pelted with rocks and bottles.The claim follows criticism of the mayor for, over the weekend, saying they were giving space to those who ""wished to destroy.""Rawlings-Blake has defended her handling of the unrest, which grew out of protests over the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody.The mayor, in an interview with Fox News' Bill Hemmer on Tuesday, denied any order was issued to hold back on Monday.""You have to understand, it is not holding back.

"WASHINGTON -- The audience should have belonged to Sen. Rand Paul. After all, the thousand or so clean-cut millennials in the D.C.-area ballroom were members of Young Americans for Liberty, a student group founded by Paul’s father, former Rep. Ron Paul.The kids chuckled appreciatively as Rand unspooled his tart, college-dorm-room disdain for government. But he didn’t fire them up. Neither did Utah Sen. Mike Lee, the thoughtful-sounding son of a Reagan-era U.S. solicitor general.The man who got them cheering, who got them going, who got them roaring with derisive laughter and bubbling with anger at the depredations of liberals was: Sen. Ted Cruz.Striding the stage like Elvis (if Elvis had been a college debater at Princeton and a brilliant student at Harvard Law), Cruz was the firebrand whom the conserva-geeks wanted to either meet or become.That was more than a year ago, when the first-term senator from Texas was still in the hard-right afterglow of his bid to shut down the government in a vain (in both senses) attempt to stop Obamacare.But the Young Americans for Liberty loved his loathing of the party elders, and his determination to shove a stick between the spokes of the System.And it is that emotion -- across-the-board opposition to every “liberal” idea that exists, and disgust with the System in all of its manifestations -- that Cruz hopes to tap for the energy he thinks can somehow lift him to the presidency.Uncorked anger doesn’t usually win presidential nominations, let alone presidencies. People want hope and uplift in the White House and not just expressions of outrage. The president is the person who is supposed to make things work.To some, the 44-year-old Cruz gives off a vaguely scary aura of cheerful menace. For now, as Cruz officially announces his 2016 bid, he is nearly an asterisk in the early GOP polls, well behind somewhat less apocalyptic personalities, such as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.The first is that his angry approach may fit the times. Even as the voters depend more and more on government and politics -- perhaps for that very reason -- their regard for the machinery of both continues to plummet to new lows.Cruz beat the establishment in Texas like a drum. They hate him for it, but he is also going to raise a lot of cash in, yes, Texas.He is as pure an across-the-board conservative as it is possible to find in what has to be regarded as the big leagues of politics: culturally, fiscally, in monetary policy, in foreign policy.Cruz is triple 7s on the slot machine of issues: anti-abortion, a global-warming mega-skeptic, to the right of Likud on Israel, anti-immigration to the max, big on defense spending, etc.He is a libertarian, traditional conservative, war hawk and evangelical Baptist son of a preacher who fled Fidel Castro’s Cuba. There are plenty of philosophical and tactical contradictions in Cruz’s construct, but he ignores them all.","Draft as a TED Talk script, exploring the article's main idea and its broader significance.","Cruz's ability to evoke strong emotions, both positive and negative, is evident in his ability to draw large crowds and generate significant debate.

"""Donald Trump is the nominee, whether people like it or not,"" the former House speaker, during a question-and-answer session at a hedge fund conference in Las Vegas, told attendees Thursday. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, made clear he would support the nominee.But that doesn¹t mean Boehner supports what Trump is pitching on the campaign trail. Asked, rapid fire, whether he supported Trump's proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S., his proposal to build a wall on the border of Mexico and the New York billionaire¹s plan to aggressively use tariffs to attack foreign trade competitors, Boehner repeatedly answered with one word: ""No.""He also said Trump¹s foreign policy stance, laid out in a speech two weeks ago, didn't align with his views. Still, Boehner said, ""Anybody who doesn't think Donald Trump can win, just watch.""Boehner¹s comments come two weeks after saying, during a question-and-answer session at Stanford University, that he and Trump were ""texting buddies."" It was at that same event that he called then-GOP presidential candidate and regular Boehner tormenter Ted Cruz, the Texas senator, ""Lucifer in the flesh."" Cruz has since suspended his campaign, clearing the way for Trump to secure the title of ""presumptive nominee"" for the party. Boehner, in an unsolicited comment, couldn't hide his feelings on that front. ""Thank God the guy from Texas didn't win,"" he said. As all eyes in Washington were on Trump¹s meetings with top GOP lawmakers, Boehner weighed in on the decision by his replacement as speaker -- the lawmaker Boehner pushed, lobbied and cajoled to take the job, Paul Ryan -- not to immediately endorse Trump. ""I think Paul was just being cautious,"" Boehner said, adding that he ""doesn't have any doubt"" things will ""get smoothed over.""

"The race for the White House has become even more uncertain as federal investigators begin searching through newly discovered emails belonging to Hillary Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin.The emails were found on a laptop of Abedin's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, who is currently under investigation for allegedly sexting an underage girl.Officials have obtained a warrant to search those emails, but it is unlikely the review will be completed by Election Day.Meanwhile, the presidential race has tightened dramatically in the last several days.The gap was closing even before Friday's news that the FBI would reopen the investigation into Clinton's emails, but now the contest is virtually a dead heat.Even though the polls are close, Clinton still has an apparent advantage in the Electoral College. Consequently, both candidates are hitting key swing states where the election will likely be decided.Addressing supporters at a rally in Kent, Ohio, Monday, the former secretary of state sounded defiant about the email controversy.""I'm sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of wrongdoing with just days to go? That's a good question,"" Clinton said.""First of all, for those of you who are concerned about my use of personal email, I understand. As I said, I'm not making excuses, I understand and I regret it,"" she continued. ""They should look at them. And I'm sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year.

"Under new overtime rules, employees will be injured as well.The Labor Department’s change to the overtime rule is a harsh blow to millions of small businesses and their employees. According to NFIB research, approximately 44% of small businesses would be affected. The department claims that 4.2 million workers could potentially benefit from the change. That’s not consistent with the department’s own analysis.In fact, buried within the regulation, the department projects that many workers won’t receive any additional pay and that others will lose pay. According to Labor, 60% of the newly eligible employees don’t work overtime right now. The department also estimates that the average hourly pay rate will decline in 2017. The talking points say this is a raise for workers, but the economic analysis says something completely different.Most small businesses have razor-thin margins, and they cannot simply raise prices to cover higher costs without losing customers. Moreover, the median personal income for small business owners is roughly $68,000 annually, according to NFIB research. Big corporations can trim shareholder dividends, cut CEO pay or move production facilities out of the country. Those aren’t options for most small firms.Employees will be injured as well. Managers who haven’t punched a clock in years will have to go back to filling out a time sheet. They will even have to take into account work from home such as checking email or fielding a phone call. Essentially, they’ll be demoted from their management positions to hourly jobs.The overtime rule is another government mandate that makes it costlier and more difficult to run a business and create jobs. NFIB surveys its members every month to identify their top concerns. Government regulations consistently rank at the top.Every minute that business owners must devote to keeping records, filling out paperwork and dealing with government inspectors is a minute they don’t have to run their businesses. Every dollar it costs to comply with all of those rules is a dollar they cannot reinvest in new jobs, better equipment or customer service.Juanita Duggan is president and CEO of the National Federation of Independent Business.","Rewrite the text as a series of public service announcements, highlighting key messages or warnings.","****Public Service Announcement 1:**""The new overtime rule is a harsh blow to millions of small businesses and their employees.

"WASHINGTON –- Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign on Wednesday announced a massive fundraising haul in the quarter that ended on June 30, further cementing her status as the clear front-runner in the 2016 race.All told, the Democratic candidate and former secretary of state raised more than $45 million in primary campaign contributions between her campaign announcement in April and the end of June. That figure, according to a Clinton aide, is the most that any candidate has ever raised in their opening quarter, topping President Barack Obama's roughly $42 million in the first quarter of 2011.Clinton's haul would also shatter the previous record for an opening fundraising total by a non-incumbent presidential candidate, which she herself set in the first quarter of 2007. To set that record, she raised $26 million in the first three months of her first presidential campaign while transferring an additional $10 million from her Senate campaign account.

"Really the only unusual or exciting thing about this jobs report is how unusual it is for something so thoroughly expected and non-game-changing to happen. Adding a bit over 200,000 jobs a month is both what analysts thought would happen, and also a trajectory that is consistent with a continued slow decline in unemployment but no real labor market boom.Dive deeper into the data, and the basic lack of surprises only continues. Labor force participation is up, but only very slightly. Hourly wages are up, but only very slightly.There's nothing about this jobs report that is likely to change the Federal Reserve's mind about anything, and therefore no reason to expect financial markets to have any particular reaction. Those who think the Fed's current course is dangerously inflationary will keep thinking that. Those who (more correctly!) think the Fed's current course is unreasonably inflation-averse will keep thinking that, as well. Janet Yellen will keep thinking she's on the right track.Wage growth appears to have settled into a steady pattern that is somewhat better than what we saw at the depths of the recession, but far below what was considered normal before the recession. Partially offsetting this, overall consumer price inflation has been abnormally low for a couple of years now. There are also some compositional effects pulling average wages down as a large cohort of inexperienced 20-somethings have been entering the workforce.Overall it is a little difficult to understand why some of the small upward bumps have been interpreted in some quarters as a sign of an imminent inflationary breakout. Even the strongest wage-growth months have been weak compared with 2006 or 2007, years that were not exactly halcyon days for the American worker.Perhaps the clearest sign of how not-yet-completed America's recovery comes from looking at the level of full-time jobs, which is still well below where it was in 2007:The population, needless to say, has grown in the intervening years, meaning that the failure to fully catch up in job growth makes it difficult for rank-and-file workers to gain bargaining leverage.","Transform the article into a fantasy tale, with elements of magic or myth intertwined with real events.","In the realm of the emerald hills and the whispers of the wind, there once upon a time, a tale unfolded that intertwined the real with the mythical.

"Federal laws already allow people across the country the option to register to vote at the DMV. But Oregon and California's laws are pioneering because they do it automatically.It's hard to overstate how novel this concept is for the US. Throughout much of United States history, governments frequently put up barriers aimed at preventing people from voting, such as property ownership requirements, poll taxes, or literacy tests.Gradually, many of these barriers have fallen to make it easier for people to register. However, many states, including California, still close off registration weeks to a month before an election — an artificial obstacle that can prevent perfectly qualified people from voting if they simply miss a deadline.These new proposals remove those obstacles. Oregon's law will register all adult citizens in the DMV's database, while California's law will be implemented more gradually, as people get or renew their licenses or state IDs, or change their addresses. But both make it the government's responsibility to ensure that all eligible voters are registered.So it's a big deal that governments are now trying to make it easier and easier to vote, rather than more difficult. Matt Yglesias has argued for going even further and enshrining an affirmative right to vote in our Constitution — read his case here.In both California and Oregon, Republicans opposed these proposals, but generally didn't argue against the principle of easing registration. Instead, the criticisms have fallen along two main lines.First, critics have argued that since voter registration data is more publicly accessible than DMV information, automatically adding voters to the rolls could pose privacy concerns. However, supporters respond that people can always opt out.Second, some Republicans have cited concerns about voter fraud — usually about potential registration of unauthorized immigrants. But while California began issuing driver's licenses to unauthorized immigrants this year, these licenses are distinctively marked, and people with them would not be registered to vote automatically. And Oregon requires proof of citizenship for all driver's license applicants.Meanwhile, national Democrats are increasingly adopting mandatory voter registration as a major cause. In a speech on voting rights this June, Hillary Clinton called on all states to automatically register citizens to vote when they turn 18, unless they choose to opt out. And legislators in 15 other states have introduced bills similar to Oregon's new law — the Brennan Center is tracking them here.",Summarize the article as a catchy song lyric.,"(Verse 1)Federal laws allow you to vote,But Oregon and California shine,They're pioneers in the US,Automating voter registration.(Chorus)It's a big deal, you know,Making it easier to vote,No more barriers to hold you back,The government's on your track.(Verse 2)In California and Oregon,Republicans opposed the plan,"

"Updated at 10:04 a.m. ETThe Vatican has announced an end to an overhaul of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious — an abrupt conclusion to a five-year doctrinal overhaul of the main umbrella group for nuns in the U.S. that began in 2012.The Vatican said Thursday that it has accepted a report on the overhaul of the LCWR ""marking the conclusion of the Doctrinal Assessment"" of the umbrella group.NPR's Sylvia Poggioli tells our Newscast unit the unexpected announcement is seen as a sign of Pope Francis' focus on a more merciful church.LCWR leaders met with Pope Francis later Thursday, during their annual visit to Rome. David Gibson of Religion News Service described the meeting as ""another indicator of the thaw in relations."" He added:The Rev.

"An FBI dive team reportedly pulled an object from a San Bernardino lake Friday, seeking evidence pinpointing the motive and history of the attackers who killed more than a dozen people during a holiday party.One diver handed the unknown item to an official wearing gloves, who put the object in a plastic bag, the Press-Enterprise reports.Investigators are looking for a hard drive that may have been dumped in the lake, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told The Associated Press. David Bowdich, chief of the FBI's Los Angeles office, said investigative leads indicated the shooters had been in the area the day of the massacre and said the search of the lake could take days.Fox News has learned that in 2012, one of the gunmen, Syed Farook, conspired with former neighbor Enrique Marquez, the man who purchased the rifles used in the deadly attack in San Bernardino on Dec. 2. The plot would have targeted the Los Angeles area.It appeared the two were scared off the idea by the November 2012 arrests of four Southern California men attempting to travel to Afghanistan to wage holy war.The small, urban lake is about 3 miles north of the shooting site.Authorities say Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on his fellow San Bernardino County health inspectors during a holiday party, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. The couple died hours later in a police shootout, leaving behind a 6-month-old daughter.FBI Director James Comey has said Farook had been in communication with individuals who were being scrutinized by the FBI in terrorism investigations, but that the contact he had was not enough to bring him onto the law enforcement radar.The FBI has interviewed hundreds of people and conducted searches looking for evidence. Bowdich says it's possible the agency will do neighborhood canvasses in the future, too.Fox News' Adam Housley and The Associated Press contributed to this report.","Create a mindfulness meditation script, inspired by the themes of the article.","Take a few deep breaths, and allow the tranquility of this moment to wash over you.Close your eyes and imagine yourself standing in the middle of the lake.

"State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday that an unknown U.S. official made a request over the phone to delete several minutes of a December 2013 video of the exchange between reporters and a State Department spokeswoman. The State Department routinely posts on its site the briefing that it holds nearly every day with the diplomatic press corps.Kirby said the department technician who made the edit could not recall who requested it.The deleted portion of the video involves questions about a previous press briefing in 2012 in which then-State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland denied secret talks between the U.S. and Iran about a potential nuclear deal were taking place.After it was revealed in December 2013 that secret talks between the U.S. and Iran actually had taken place, then-spokeswoman Jen Psaki admitted the administration lied in order to protect the secret negotiations.Earlier this month Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes acknowledged to The New York Times that the administration was deceptive about the talks, creating a ""narrative"" that they did not take place. When James Rosen of Fox News -- who asked the original questions of Psaki -- tried to refer back to the video last month, he found the exchange had been deleted. Kirby, who originally called the deletion a ""glitch,"" said Wednesday that he asked State Department lawyers to look into the matter after being notified about the omission. ""They learned that a specific request was made to excise that portion of the briefing. We do not know who made the request to edit the video or why it was made,"" Kirby said. Another senior State Department official said the technician found the request ""unusual"" and consulted her supervisor before making the edit. The supervisor, who also could not remember the name of the person who called, approved the request because it came from someone ""from a certain level and credibility"" in the Department of Public Affairs. ""Although this person did not remember the person who called her, or the person they were calling on behalf of, she remembers it was not (Jen) Psaki,"" this official said. ""Jen did not request it, did not know about it and had nothing to do with it."" Psaki, who now is the White House communications director, tweeted Wednesday that she was unaware of the episode: ""I had no knowledge of nor would I have approved of any form of editing or cutting my briefing transcript on any subject while @StateDept."" Kirby noted that the full briefing transcript, including the exchange on Iran, had always been available on the State Department website and that the omitted video has since been replaced with a complete version that had been archived with the Defense Department. He said that was the only instance he was aware of in which briefing videos were edited, though he couldn't be sure there weren't others. He announced a new policy Wednesday in which every video would be posted immediately with all edits disclosed. ""To my surprise, the Bureau of Public Affairs did not have in place any rules governing this type of action,"" he said. ""Therefore, we are taking immediate steps to craft appropriate protocols on this issue, as we believe that deliberately removing a portion of the video was not and is not in keeping with the State Department's commitment to transparency and public accountability."" Because such rules weren't previously in place, Kirby said he found ""no reason"" to press forward with a more formal investigation.","Transform the article into a board of directors' report, analyzing the story's events in a corporate context.","The video in question involved questions about a previous press briefing in 2012 in which then-State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland denied secret talks between the U.S. and Iran about a potential nuclear deal.

"Two women with an interest in violent jihad were arrested in Queens, New York, Thursday morning as part of an FBI sting, after allegedly plotting to create explosive devices to use in a terrorist attack in the United States.Noelle Velentzas, 28, and Asia Siddiqui, 31, had allegedly taken several steps toward constructing an explosive device and discussed their activities with an undercover officer, according to court documents. They had not yet identified a target for their planned attack, federal authorities said. The defendants are U.S. citizens who live in Queens and were roommates until recently.During regular meetings between the two women and the undercover agent, both women espoused jihadist beliefs and praised past terrorist attacks in the United States. Velentzas allegedly showed the officer her cell phone, which had a background image of Osama bin Laden holding an AK-47. Siddiqui once said that Velentzas had been obsessed with pressure cookers since the Boston Marathon bombings, and Velentzas joked about how she planned to cook ""food"" in a pressure cooker she had recently purchased.It appears Velentzas eventually became suspicious of the undercover agent's identity, allegedly using her phone in November and December to access webpages with titles like ""Learning the Identity of a Confidential Informant,"" ""How to Spot Undercover Police,"" ""Is S/he an Informant?"" She also researched how to detect bugs.Yet she and Siddiqui continued to meet with the agent in the months that followed. Siddiqui purchased several propane tanks and stored them in her basement, and discussed them during the meetings. ""I got everything up in this joint, I already told you. If you guys... once we learn... I got everything up in this joint,"" she allegedly said. ""Yo, she got everything. This is like the Home Depot,"" the undercover agent responded.Velentzas then asked Siddiqui why she hadn't told them that she had purchased the tanks, but Siddiqui insisted she had. ""She's the master of not telling you shit that's really important,"" Velentzas said, later telling the undercover agent that they had to ""keep it a hundred"" so they could trust one another.""Cause how could you have a... have a open conversation about some shit that is uhm... federal-time worthy shit and the person... you know... is... half-ass in communication?"" Velentzas said. ""I""m gonna die for your ass and you don't communicate?""Federal authorities apparently have been aware of the women for a number of years. Velentzas ""expressed violent jihadist ideology and an interest in terrorism"" in meetings with the undercover agent back in 2013, and said that being a martyr guarantees entrance into heaven. Siddiqui allegedly wrote a poem in 2009 for a magazine called Jihad Recollections, which was a predecessor to the al-Qaeda publication Inspire, and sent a letter to a man arrested for trying to detonate a bomb during a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon, in 2010. She had repeated contact with members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, according to court documents.","Write as an open-source project description, calling for contributions related to the article's topic.","The two women, U.S. citizens residing in Queens, were alleged to be plotting to create explosive devices for a terrorist attack in the United States.The investigation began with the undercover officer establishing regular meetings with the two women.

"While Donald Trump doubled down this week on his vow to make Mexico pay for his proposed southern border wall, his campaign is reported to be weighing options that don’t necessarily involve the seemingly far-fetched scenario of the Mexican government handing America a great, big check.LifeZette first reported that the Republican presidential nominee and his top advisers are looking at using assets seized from drug cartels and other traffickers. This reportedly could involve establishing a “joint border security fund” -- holding seized assets from crackdowns on both sides of the border – for border construction and maintenance.Trump, asked Thursday by Fox News about the report, did not deny the option is on the table.“There are many ways that they can pay for the wall,” Trump said, calling it a “negotiation.”But he again insisted, “The United States will not be paying for the wall. Mexico will be paying for the wall.”Breitbart News, whose chairman Stephen Bannon left to be Trump’s campaign CEO, also reported that cartel resources would be seized to fund the wall if Trump wins.Trump supporter, and former presidential primary rival, Ben Carson floated another option Thursday night.Speaking with Fox News, Carson said money saved from enforcing the border could be used – though he did not elaborate on what level of savings the federal government could expect, particularly when Trump is proposing spending more money on border security resources.“Recognize that a lot of money is going to be saved by enforcing our borders, by not, you know, giving various types of benefits to people who are here illegally,” Carson said. “That money is money that we otherwise would not have had and that can be applied to the wall and various other things. That’s I believe the spirit in which that comment is made. I don't think Mexico is going to write a check out and say here, pay for the wall.”Trump has not addressed such details on the stump.He declared in his immigration policy speech Wednesday night that, “Mexico will pay for the wall … they don’t know it yet, but they’re going to pay.”That came after Trump met with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City, and both men left the meeting battling over the payment issue. Trump said they didn’t discuss “payment,” while Pena Nieto said he made clear Mexico will not put up the money.According to The Wall Street Journal, Trump added the line about payment into his Phoenix speech, in response to Pena Nieto’s claims.If a Trump administration did pursue using cartel assets to fund a wall, it would take billions. Trump has estimated the wall could be built for as little as $8 billion, though other analyses have put the cost much higher.Estimates of Mexican cartel revenue vary drastically.

He said that the other likely contender, Senate Minority Whip Richard J.

"Shouts of “shame, shame, shame” erupted in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday as Republican lawmakers narrowly defeated legislation to protect the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees of government contractors.The measure, an amendment to a veterans and military construction spending bill introduced by New York Democrat Sean Maloney, initially had enough “yes” votes to pass, according to the count in the House chamber.But House Republican leaders extended the time allowed for the vote as they urged enough party members to change their positions to defeat it by a vote of 213 to 212.All 183 Democrats who voted backed the amendment, joined by 29 Republicans. All 213 “no’s” were from Republicans. Eight House members – three Republicans and five Democrats – did not vote.LGBT rights have been a hot-button issue during the 2016 election season. National politics have featured debate over whether making cakes for same-sex couples violates bakers’ religious freedom or whether the government should decide which public bathrooms are used by transgender people.Democrats chanted “shame, shame, shame” at Republicans, drawing attention to the vote. Steny Hoyer, the number two House Democrat, denounced it in a fiery speech. “We had 217 people for non-discrimination right up until the last moment,” he said.Thursday’s emotional vote came hours after the House late on Wednesday passed a $602 billion defense authorization bill that included “religious freedom” language that critics said would allow contractors to discriminate against LGBT individuals.The House Rules committee had angered Democrats by voting along party lines late on Tuesday not to allow a vote on an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would have eliminated that language.Republicans who backed the provision said it was necessary to protect the religious rights of military contractors and not intended to be discriminatory.","Rewrite the text as a wedding vow, romantically linking the themes or messages of the story.","My beloved, I stand before you today with a heart filled with both joy and sorrow.

"MIAMI - Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio dropped out of the race for president Tuesday, ending his White House bid after a humbling loss in his home state to Donald Trump.""It is not God's plan that I be president in 2016 or maybe ever,"" the Florida senator told a crowd of supporters in Miami.While he didn't name Trump, Rubio warned against embracing his brand of divisive politics: ""I ask the American people, do not give into the fear, do not give into the frustration,"" he said.Rubio's decision was prompted by losses in all but three of the presidential nomination contests, but Florida's winner-take-all primary proved the most devastating. Only six years earlier, he was a tea party favorite who crushed the GOP's ""establishment"" candidate to win a seat in the U.S. Senate.But the political tables turned on him in the 2016 presidential race, where he was lambasted as mainstream in a year when voters cried out for an outsider.In the final week, he dedicated time and resources almost exclusively to the Sunshine State, urging voters to stop Trump from ""hijacking"" the Republican Party. He went so far as to tell his supporters in Ohio to vote for Buckeye State governor John Kasich since his chances were better to win there.Despite his intense rivalry with Trump, Rubio only indirectly criticized him during much of the campaign. He pivoted to an all-out assault on the businessman's character and ethics after a dismal Super Tuesday performance March 1, when he clinched only one of the 11 contests.In recent weeks, the attacks deviated from policy to personal. At one point, Rubio equated Trump's small hands with his manhood. But the strategy backfired with voters and donors and Rubio later said he regretted the attacks.Like other Republicans, Rubio had pledged to support the eventual GOP nominee. But, in recent days, he expressed having second thoughts. He told reporters Saturday that the chaos and divisiveness at Trump's rallies, including the one in Chicago canceled last week, had made it harder for him to view the front-runner as a viable candidate.The 44-year-old senator had seemed destined for the national spotlight. Time magazine placed him on its cover in early 2013, dubbing him the ""Republican Savior.""In under a decade, he had gone from West Miami commissioner to state legislator to Florida House Speaker. In 2010, he challenged a sitting governor for a U.S. Senate seat and won after starting more than 50 percentage points behind in the polls, catapulted by a wave of tea party supporters.He launched his presidential campaign at the Miami Freedom Tower, where tens of thousands of his fellow Cuban-Americans had been processed as refugees. He promised lower taxes, less regulation, tighter federal spending, modernized immigration laws, and the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare.At the time, Rubio's friend and one-time mentor, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, seemed his biggest hurdle to get to the Oval Office.Enter Trump. By mid-summer, he turned the Bush-Rubio rivalry into a telenovela without the sizzle. Bush dropped out after the Feb. 20 South Carolina primary.In the Iowa caucuses, Rubio came in a better-than-expected third place, nearly beating Trump for second. He then banked on a big showing in New Hampshire but a stunningly poor debate performance - in which he frequently repeated talking points and was called ""scripted"" by rival Chris Christie - led to a dismal fifth place.""Our disappointment tonight is not on you. It's on me,"" he told supporters that night.Rubio came in second in South Carolina and Nevada, but on March 1, Super Tuesday, he collected just one win in 11 contests.The final blow came two weeks later, at home.Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) came out as a vaccine choicer Tuesday, saying it should be up to parents to decide whether to inoculate their children against deadly diseases that could infect the rest of the population.His stance was looser than the one he took last year against Kaci Hickox, the nurse Christie forcibly quarantined over Ebola fears when she returned to the United States after helping patients in West Africa. There was never any evidence that Hickox had symptoms of Ebola, a far less contagious disease than the measles, which is currently spreading across the country due to parents who refuse to vaccinate their children.On Monday night, Hickox went on ""All In with Chris Hayes"" on MSNBC and blasted Christie for his vaccination comments.""I think this is a good example of Gov. Christie making some very ill-informed statements. We heard it a lot during the Ebola discussion, and now it seems to have happened again,"" said Hickox.""We know that vaccines are safe, and we know that vaccines save lives,"" she said. ""I have worked in a measles outbreak in northern Nigeria before. We were seeing about 2,000 children a week with measles. It is a scary disease. I know that these families of these 100 people who have the disease now could tell you a little bit about what the disease looks like and how much misery it causes. After the vaccine was implemented in 1963, there was a large reduction in cases, about 98 percent. And I believe it was 1989 to '91, there was a resurgence. ... The stakes are high. We have to protect our most vulnerable populations.""Christie made his controversial vaccination comments to reporters during his three-day trip to London, as he weighs whether to jump in the 2016 presidential field. Christie said he and his wife had vaccinated their children but understood ""that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so that’s the balance that the government has to decide.""Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts later clarified the governor's comments, saying, ""To be clear: The Governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated. At the same time different states require different degrees of vaccination, which is why he was calling for balance in which ones government should mandate.""",Design a lesson plan for teaching the article's topic in a middle school class.,**Lesson Plan:****Grade Level:** Middle School**Subject:** Health and Science**Time:** 45 minutes**Learning Objectives:*** Students will be able to explain the importance of vaccinations in preventing disease.* Students will be able to understand the potential consequences of not vaccinating.* Students will be able to
"THE STING videos targeting Planned Parenthood are hard to watch. Doctors talk clinically, some say callously, about harvesting fetal tissue. Technicians identify and isolate tiny organs. References are made to “it’s a baby” or “it’s another boy.” The videos were taken surreptitiously and were artfully edited to produce maximum discomfort about complicated issues that, for many, are inherently uncomfortable.That truths were distorted to paint an inaccurate and unfair picture of a health organization that provides valuable services to women — as well as to demonize research that leads to important medical advances — doesn’t matter to antiabortion activists. Or, sadly, to the politicians who pander to them.Planned Parenthood is under virulent attack for the role a small portion of its affiliates play in helping women who want to donate fetal tissue for medical research. The antiabortion group Center for Medical Progress has orchestrated a propaganda campaign accusing the nation’s largest provider of abortions of profiting from the illegal sale of fetal tissue, a charge refuted by Planned Parenthood.None of the videos released shows anything illegal and, in fact, the full footage of Planned Parenthood executives meeting with people presumed to be buyers for a human biologics company include repeated assertions that clinics are not selling tissue but only seeking permitted reimbursement costs for expenses. Indeed, the Colorado clinic featured in the videos refused to enter into a contract with the phony company because of its failure to meet its legal and ethical standards.Such facts, though, haven’t stopped officials in several Republican-led states, including Texas, Louisiana and Ohio, from launching investigations of Planned Parenthood, even though affiliates in those states don’t facilitate fetal tissue donations. In Washington, Senate Republicans have fast-tracked a bid to defund Planned Parenthood, with a vote set for Monday. Fortunately, it’s unlikely there will be 60 votes to advance the bill, as cutting off funds to Planned Parenthood would be irresponsible.No federal money is used by Planned Parenthood to provide abortions except in some rare exceptions. So cutting off government funds, mostly through Medicaid and grants, would only hurt the thousands of people, most of them low-income women, who each day depend upon Planned Parenthood for birth control, cancer screenings, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and other health services. Given that many of the clinics are in medically underserved areas, it’s a myth, as Republicans claim, that other providers can fill the gap. Shutting down clinics would make it harder for many women to obtain birth control — and the last thing either side of the abortion debate should want is an increase in unwanted pregnancies that result in more abortions.We are under no illusions that the vendetta against Planned Parenthood will end. Conservative Republicans are already threatening to shut down the federal government in the fall by blocking any spending that includes money for Planned Parenthood.

"Dragging on for an excruciating eternity, this election season has demeaned democracy, elevated mediocrity and insulted and embarrassed us all on just about every level imaginable: Intellectually, with regard to the lack of focus on policy and substance; ethically, with a complete disregard for integrity and character; and morally, driven by a disgraceful descent into racist and xenophobic vitriol.Given that our country has consistently climbed down the educational attainment ladder, and that inane and banal reality TV shows draw more eyeballs than books and opera , it should not surprise us that a growing swath of the electorate is more enthused by a coarse, bullying celebrity than by an awkward policy wonk.But what's doubly disappointing -- as we head into the crucial presidential debates -- is that this lack of intellectual depth is enabled not only by the candidates, but also by the topics they gravitate to, which the media frenzy then exacerbates.These are topics that don't matter when it comes to making a difference in the future of our country: the size of a candidate's hands (and therefore other body parts), the now-moot birther issue, the Monica Lewinsky and Marla Maples scandals, the name-calling and finger pointing about who is more racist than whom, who is healthier than whom.","Translate the text into a visual infographic, summarizing key facts and figures in a graphical format.","****Visual Infographic:****Title:** Democracy Demeaned, Mediocrity Elevated**Key Points:*** The election season has been characterized by a lack of focus on policy and substance, elevated mediocrity, and the spread of racist and xenophobic vitriol.* The decline in educational attainment and the popularity of inane reality TV shows have contributed to a growing disconnect between the electorate and intellectual pursuits.* The candidates' lack of intellectual depth and"
"State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday that an unknown U.S. official made a request over the phone to delete several minutes of a December 2013 video of the exchange between reporters and a State Department spokeswoman. The State Department routinely posts on its site the briefing that it holds nearly every day with the diplomatic press corps.Kirby said the department technician who made the edit could not recall who requested it.The deleted portion of the video involves questions about a previous press briefing in 2012 in which then-State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland denied secret talks between the U.S. and Iran about a potential nuclear deal were taking place.After it was revealed in December 2013 that secret talks between the U.S. and Iran actually had taken place, then-spokeswoman Jen Psaki admitted the administration lied in order to protect the secret negotiations.Earlier this month Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes acknowledged to The New York Times that the administration was deceptive about the talks, creating a ""narrative"" that they did not take place. When James Rosen of Fox News -- who asked the original questions of Psaki -- tried to refer back to the video last month, he found the exchange had been deleted. Kirby, who originally called the deletion a ""glitch,"" said Wednesday that he asked State Department lawyers to look into the matter after being notified about the omission. ""They learned that a specific request was made to excise that portion of the briefing. We do not know who made the request to edit the video or why it was made,"" Kirby said. Another senior State Department official said the technician found the request ""unusual"" and consulted her supervisor before making the edit. The supervisor, who also could not remember the name of the person who called, approved the request because it came from someone ""from a certain level and credibility"" in the Department of Public Affairs. ""Although this person did not remember the person who called her, or the person they were calling on behalf of, she remembers it was not (Jen) Psaki,"" this official said. ""Jen did not request it, did not know about it and had nothing to do with it."" Psaki, who now is the White House communications director, tweeted Wednesday that she was unaware of the episode: ""I had no knowledge of nor would I have approved of any form of editing or cutting my briefing transcript on any subject while @StateDept."" Kirby noted that the full briefing transcript, including the exchange on Iran, had always been available on the State Department website and that the omitted video has since been replaced with a complete version that had been archived with the Defense Department. He said that was the only instance he was aware of in which briefing videos were edited, though he couldn't be sure there weren't others. He announced a new policy Wednesday in which every video would be posted immediately with all edits disclosed. ""To my surprise, the Bureau of Public Affairs did not have in place any rules governing this type of action,"" he said. ""Therefore, we are taking immediate steps to craft appropriate protocols on this issue, as we believe that deliberately removing a portion of the video was not and is not in keeping with the State Department's commitment to transparency and public accountability."" Because such rules weren't previously in place, Kirby said he found ""no reason"" to press forward with a more formal investigation.","Develop as a script for a 5-minute documentary, including narrator lines and interview quotes.",**The State Department has admitted to deleting several minutes of a December 2013 video of a briefing with the diplomatic press corps.

"Muhammad will be back on the cover of the next edition of Charlie Hebdo, along with a message of forgiveness from surviving staffers at the French satirical magazine where 12 people were killed last week by a pair of Islamist brothers angered over the publication's penchant for showing images of the prophet.The decimated, but uncowed magazine upped its usual print run of 60,000 copies to 3 million for the magazine, due out Wednesday but released to the French newspaper Liberation. Fierce bidding on eBay had editions commanding as much as $500 following the outpouring of support for Charlie Hebdo, whose four top cartoonists were among the dozen killed.

"PARIS, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Police arrested a dozen people suspected of helping the Islamist militant gunmen in last week's Paris killings, the city prosecutor's office said on Friday as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived for talks.The arrests came after Belgian police killed two men who fired on them during one of about a dozen raids on Thursday against an Islamist group and German police said they had arrested two people following a raid on 11 properties linked to radical Salafists.Centered on southern Paris suburbs including the Montrouge area where a young policewoman was killed in the attacks, the arrests were for suspected ""logistical support"" for the shootings, an official said.Seventeen victims and the three attackers died in three days of violence in Paris last week that began with an assault on the offices of satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo.Paris's Gare de l'Est train station was evacuated at 8:00 a.m. local time (0700 GMT) after an alert but reopened about an hour later, the SNCF state railway said, without giving further details.Kerry had said on Thursday that his visit to France was to give a ""big hug"" to Paris. Senior U.S. officials were absent from a commemoration march held in Paris on Sunday attended by dozens of world leaders. President Barack Obama's administration conceded that was an omission.""I think you know that you have the full and heartfelt condolences of the American people and I know you know that we share the pain and the horror of everything that you went through,"" Kerry told Hollande on Friday.""Together we need to find the right responses and this is the purpose of our meeting here today, beyond the friendship,"" he said.Investigators are still poring over the complex chain of events that led to three French nationals - two brothers with Algerian roots and a third of African extraction - perpetrating the worst attacks on French soil for decades.Belgian investigators said they are trying to establish if a man detained in the city of Charleroi on suspicion of arms trafficking had any links with Amedy Coulibaly, the gunman who killed four Jews at a kosher supermarket in Paris last week.His lawyer Michel Bouchat told French media the man was not an associate of Coulibaly and had merely sold him a car. The man in question already contacted police on Tuesday to say he had had contacts with Hayat Boumedienne, the partner of Coulibaly now believed to be in Syria.

"The White House and Republican leaders in Congress face long odds in trying to revive trade legislation after a telling defeat engineered by President Barack Obama's fellow Democrats.Obama's ambitious trade agenda is in serious doubt, as is his quest for a capstone second-term achievement.Without the power to negotiate trade deals that Congress can approve or reject, but not amend, Obama has little chance of securing the Pacific Rim pact that his administration has worked toward for years.Friday's rebuff highlighted the strained relations between Obama and congressional Democrats, who voted down a worker assistance program crucial to the negotiating authority measure just hours after the president implored them not to.Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, had worked in rare tandem on this issue, yet their inability to deliver raises the question of whether much else will get done with Republicans running Congress and Obama in the White House for the next 18 months.""This isn't over yet,"" Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., a main supporter of the trade legislation. ""I'm hopeful that the Democrats understand the consequences and get together with the president and finish this as soon as possible.""House GOP leaders took steps that would allow another vote on the worker retraining program in coming days, but that would require at least 90 votes to shift.Republicans sounded pessimistic that they could add many more votes for a program that most on their side deride as wasteful and unnecessary.House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California and her labor-backed allies are determined to oppose the Trade Adjustment Assistance program as a way to collapse the entire package. So it seems unlikely that enough Democratic votes would emerge to save the program, even though the party has promoted it for years.""Some of my Democratic colleagues are in danger of self-immolation"" on the workers' program and ""I think that's sad,"" said Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., one of the few Democrats who backed Obama on Friday's votes.Another possible route is to send revised legislation back to the Senate. But senators approved the larger package only narrowly last month after intense battles, and the White House desperately wants to avoid giving opponents there another chance to strangle the legislation.White House press secretary Josh Earnest dismissed Friday's outcome as an ""entanglement"" and ""procedural snafu.""But it was more than a ""snafu"" that caused Pelosi and the majority of House Democrats to revolt against their president.The White House, congressional Republicans and business groups argued that the special negotiating power is a necessary tool for trade deals opening up crucial markets to American goods.Union-backed House Democrats never bought the argument. They felt burned by promises from past administrations about trade deals they blame for job and manufacturing losses in their districts.Trade bills have always had a tough road in Congress. After election losses in recent years the House Democratic caucus is smaller and more liberal, attuned to economic issues in the wake of the financial sector meltdown and recession.Against that backdrop Obama was not able to bring enough House Democrats his way. Pelosi, from trade-dependent San Francisco, announced on the House floor at the last moment that she would be siding with the majority of her caucus and against her president.""We want a better deal for America's workers,"" she said.",Summarize the key points as if explaining to a curious ten yours old.,The White House and Republican leaders in Congress are facing challenges in trying to revive trade legislation. The main issue is a worker assistance program that was crucial to the negotiating authority measure.

"In some gas stations around the country, the price of a gallon of regular has dropped below $1.42. AAA and GasBuddy, two organizations that follow gasoline prices, say that gasoline prices below $2 will not be unusual in most of the United States. As oil prices fall, and refinery capacity stays strong, the price of gas could reach $1 a gallon in some areas, a level last reached in 1999. As a matter of fact, the entire states of Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Caroline have gas prices that average at or below $1.75.Gasoline prices are driven mostly by four factors: oil prices, proximity to refineries, refinery capacity and state taxes and levies. Oil prices have dropped below $33 a barrel and continue to collapse. The recent decision by Saudi Arabia to continue to keep its oil exports high essentially has dissolved the OPEC cartel. The decision also has forced the kingdom to chop its 2016 budget. This ongoing supply glut guarantees oversupply of crude. At the same time, slowing national economies in the largest countries, including China, will lower demand. China now tops the list of oil importers, according to the Financial Times, having moved ahead of the United States.The cost of producing oil from shale deposits, particularly in the United States, is greater in some cases than what it can be sold for. Nonetheless, parts of this industry continue pumping, increasing supply, while others go bankrupt because they cannot survive with crude prices so low.Several states house large refineries or are close to those that do. This is particularly the case near the Gulf of Mexico, including the massive refinery operations south of Houston. Some owned by Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) process several hundreds of thousands of barrels per day. Proximity to refineries is a factor in gasoline prices, if the refineries are running at or near capacity and produce gasoline instead of other petroleum products.Finally, gas taxes in several states are well below the national average of $0.4869 a gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. In some low gas price states, these taxes are below $0.40. This includes South Carolina at $0.3515, Missouri at $0.3570 and Oklahoma at $0.3540. Low gas taxes in these states compound the effect of falling oil prices.The odds grow each day that gas prices will be $1 a gallon in some areas in the United States, particularly those where prices are already close to hitting $1.40 — and falling.24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

"WASHINGTON — House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday that Senate Democrats should ""get off their ass"" and stop blocking a $40 billion Homeland Security bill that would derail President Obama's immigration programs.Boehner's comments came a day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the Senate has reached a stalemate and ""the next move obviously is up to the House."" Senate Democrats voted three times last week to block the DHS funding bill from moving forward. They object to House-passed provisions that would cut off all funds to carry out Obama's executive orders on immigration.The two Republican leaders seem to be each placing responsibility on the other chamber for what happens next on the funding bill. Unless Congress acts, funding for the Department of Homeland Security will expire on Feb. 27 and the agency will face a partial shutdown.Boehner said the House will not take up a revised bill despite the Senate impasse.""The House has done its job,"" Boehner, R-Ohio, said at a news conference after meeting with House Republicans. ""Why don't you go ask the Senate Democrats when they're going to get off their ass and do something other than to vote 'no'?""Obama announced in November that he would protect about 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation and allow them to work legally in the U.S. His program would help the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens. It also would expand his 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which gives temporary legal status and work permits to undocumented immigrants brought to the USA as children.The House-passed bill would cut off all funding for the 2012 DACA program as well as blocking funds for Obama's latest immigration orders. Senate Democrats say they will only support the DHS funding bill if the immigration provisions are scrapped.""If Congress wants stronger border security and immigration enforcement, a clean funding bill for DHS is what we should be rallying around,"" said Sen.

"The 62-38 vote to end debate on the bill, moving it toward a final vote, was a victory for Obama, who had linked with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, to push the bill despite opposition from Senate Democratic leaders.""This last vote was a major step forward on this important legislation,"" said Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Republican who sponsored the bill.The Senate is now set to vote on changes to the bill, including one that would force the Obama administration to use trade deals to crack down on countries that manipulate the value of their currencies to give their exports a price advantage in the United States — an amendment the White House opposes because it would add a huge new complication into trade negotiations.Even though Senate passage is ultimately now much more likely, the House could be tougher. There, tea party conservatives are linking up with liberals to form a broader populist opposition than what existed in the Senate.The measure would hand the President six years' worth of ""trade promotion authority"" — the power to submit trade deals to Congress for an up-or-down vote with limited debate and no amendments. It's considered crucial to finalizing the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive trade deal that serves as the economic underpinning of Obama's ""Asia pivot."" It would link 40% of the world's economy, including the United States, Japan, Australia, Canada and Mexico. The trade deal has launched an obscure commerce policy discussion into a fiery political battle that has positioned the President at odds with most of his party, particularly Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and driven a wedge between the Democratic presidential front-runner, Hillary Clinton, and her primary challengers. The Senate is also looking to dispense with the trade votes to move forward and take up bills to reform or reauthorize the Patriot Act, an issue that considers to deeply divide the Senate and Republicans on Capitol Hill. The House overwhelmingly passed the USA Freedom Act, a bipartisan bill to reform the Patriot Act and effectively end the National Security Agency's bulk collection of phone data on millions of Americans. And while that bill was the result of a compromise between reform advocates and House Republican leadership, the bill is facing tough opposition in the Senate from powerful Republicans like McConnell, though the majority leader has vowed to allow a vote on the reform measure.

"Why Negotiators At Paris Climate Talks Are Tossing The Kyoto ModelNegotiators and heads of state from nearly 200 countries are meeting for the next two weeks near Paris to craft a new treaty to slow global warming.It's the 21st ""Conference of the Parties"" held by the United Nations to tackle climate change. One treaty emerged, in 1997, after the conference in Kyoto, Japan. That's no longer in effect, and, in fact, the Kyoto Protocol, as it's known, didn't slow down the gradual warming of the planet.Now governments are ever more desperate to do something to slow warming — so much so that they've thrown out the model set in Kyoto and opted for a new approach for Paris.Valli Moosa, a former climate negotiator from South Africa, says the main reason Kyoto failed to slow warming lies largely with who wasn't included in the treaty. ""You actually cannot have a meaningful agreement without China and the United States being part of it,"" he says.The U.S. Senate refused to ratify the Kyoto treaty, so the world's biggest greenhouse-gas emitter didn't have skin in the game. And developing countries, including China and India, were not required to reduce emissions. Now those countries are becoming the biggest sources of greenhouse gases as their economies thrive. China, in fact, is now the world's biggest emitter, and India isn't far behind. Moreover, the Kyoto treaty had U.N. bureaucrats and negotiators setting goals for the participating countries to lower their greenhouse gases. Many countries didn't make their targets; others dropped out. Economies were at stake, and few countries were comfortable marching to a U.N. beat.So what negotiators are bringing to the table at the Paris talks is an arrangement whereby each country is offering to reduce its own emissions by whatever amount it can manage. And everybody participates, not just developed countries.Most nations arrive with a reduction target already in hand. What will be difficult is deciding who will pay how much to developing countries to build economies that won't keep producing high emissions.French negotiator Laurence Tubiana points out that the key to success is convincing governments that those economies can be ""low-carbon,"" and that this won't be a bar to developing wealth. ""How much I'm sacrificing for the sake of emissions reductions, that's no more,"" she says of the message that negotiators are pushing. ""And now ... the Chinese, even the Indians are really coming in. It's about low-carbon economy.""Previous attempts to replace the Kyoto treaty have failed. This new approach is voluntary, and most of the world has agreed theoretically to participate, which negotiators hope will sweeten things enough to get a deal. Still to be determined, however, is who will pay for this massive revolution in the world's energy economy, and what strings will be attached to their largesse.","Convert the article into a mystery or detective story, building suspense around the events described.","The stakes were high, and the atmosphere was thick with anticipation.One of the key issues that had led to the failure of the Kyoto Protocol was the exclusion of major players like China and the United States.

"Five key states will hold Republican and Democratic primaries on Tuesday. The outcome could define the race for both parties.But as voters prepare to head to the polls, controversy over a string of violent brawls continues to swirl around Donald Trump.At a Trump rally in Ohio Sunday, Secret Service agents rushed to protect the Republican frontrunner after a protestor stormed the stage. And at other rallies throughout the weekend, Trump was constantly interrupted by hecklers.Five key states will hold Republican and Democratic primaries on Tuesday.

John Kasich is out front with 39 percent.Meanwhile in Florida, with 99 delegates and winner takes all, it's a must-win for Rubio. But a CBS poll has him currently in third place. Experts say a defeat in his home state would likely kill his campaign.Meanwhile, the Democrats were the butt of the joke in a fake Saturday Night Live campaign commercial showing Clinton, played by Kate McKinnon, slowly-- and literally -- transforming into rival Bernie Sanders just to win more young supporters.""As Millennials, your voice is important.

"WASHINGTON -- Senate leaders announced Tuesday that they've resolved a weeks-long standoff over a sex trafficking bill containing controversial anti-abortion language, clearing the way, at last, for U.S. attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch to get her confirmation vote.Lynch has been waiting for more than five months for a confirmation vote. Most recently, Republican leaders tied the vote to passage of the trafficking bill. That bill has nothing to do with Lynch, but as long as it wasn't moving, neither was Lynch's confirmation.Aides to Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas) have been working for weeks to break the impasse. As introduced, the bill would have collected fees from sex traffickers and put them into a new victims fund that would be subject to the Hyde Amendment, the federal provision that bars the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape and incest. Democrats objected to the abortion language in general, but more so because the bill expanded the Hyde Amendment to include private funds.Under the deal announced Tuesday, the bill will create two funding streams. The first one flows from fines collected from sex traffickers, and would be used for survivor services excluding health care. This stream would not include Hyde Amendment restrictions. The second one would come from community health center funds that are already subject to the abortion limits.The deal lets both parties walk away with a solid talking point: Democrats can celebrate that they prevented an expansion of Hyde, while Republicans can say they didn't cave on restricting abortion funds.""I’m pleased that we were able to reach a deal that gets this done in a way that does not expand restrictions on women’s health to non-taxpayer dollars or to new programs, and provides survivors with real dedicated funds for the support and services they need,"" Murray said on the Senate floor.A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he expects the Senate to pass the sex trafficking bill on Wednesday. From there, the Senate will move to Lynch's confirmation vote.McConnell said the attorney general nominee should get a vote ""in the next day or so.""Last week, President Barack Obama fumed that Republicans have made Lynch wait for so long, saying the delay is just ""embarrassing.""CORRECTION: This story previously misstated the nature of the survivor services that would benefit from the funding collected from sex trafficking fines under the legislation.

"Say what you will about Donald Trump, but the man is winner. Trump didn’t just wallop his opponents Tuesday — he crushed them. Up 41 percent in Delaware, 40 percent in Rhode Island, 37 percent in Pennsylvania, 33 percent in Maryland, 30 percent in Connecticut, he’s estimated to have won 110 delegates, versus five for Kasich and three for Cruz.If the race for the GOP nomination were a Little League game, the mercy rule would be imposed.Here’s where we stand today. Ted Cruz is mathematically eliminated from winning the Republican nomination before the convention in Cleveland. John Kasich has now won a single state — Ohio — where he is governor. If ever there were a series of states that would at least theoretically be fertile territory for him, it would be the Northeast, home of the last vestiges of Republican moderates. Yet, he didn’t crack 30 percent anywhere. Republicans can talk all they want about Never Trump and trying to stop him at the RNC in Cleveland. They can talk about changing the rules and holding out hope that a white knight candidate will emerge. It isn’t going to happen. Either Trump is the nominee or he’ll burn the whole thing to the ground. If you’re a gambler, go all in on the former.It is worth stepping back, however, and noting that Trump’s hammerlock over the party — and his ascendancy within the GOP — is astounding. He’s a political amateur who never held elected office; he’s a xenophobe, a bully, and a misogynist and he has run directly against the leadership of the party he hopes to lead. Yet, today he stands on the cusp of winning the nomination of the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Nixon, and Reagan. I know we’ve all become inured to Trump’s insults, his know-nothingness, and his crudeness, but it can’t be said enough — truly we are living in a political moment unlike anything that any of us has seen before.Here’s what might be even more amazing: Trump’s position as the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party is not the most remarkable political event this year. Rather, it’s that the Democratic Party is poised to nominate the first woman to be a major party candidate for president. Somehow this constantly seems to be forgotten; and whether you like Hillary Clinton or despise her, that America is poised to nominate a woman for president is a big deal.Tuesday night, Clinton racked up four more primary wins, including the delegate-rich states of Maryland and Pennsylvania. Only in Rhode Island did Bernie Sanders thwart her. Early on in the evening, before all the races had been called, he gave a “victory” speech in West Virginia that not only left unmentioned the evening’s results, but plowed forward with confidence about the road ahead. It’s a fitting metaphor for the Sanders campaign, which increasingly seems to operate in a realm completely divorced from reality. Sanders cannot and will not win the Democratic nomination. Period.Indeed, in her victory speech, Clinton — as she has increasingly done — simply ignored Sanders. Instead she aimed her daggers at her real target, Donald Trump. The Democratic race will continue, but for all intents and purposes, it is over. Clinton can now begin her pivot to the general election, and Sanders can play out the string.What we now with some certainty is that we’re only a few months away from an historic, unprecedented presidential campaign — and no matter which candidate wins on Election Day, history will be made.","Reframe the article as a manifesto, outlining a revolutionary vision or call to action based on the content.","The political landscape is shifting beneath our very feet, presenting a unique opportunity for a revolution.

"To be fair, Clinton has been on the ugly end of Republican attacks for decades – a little guardedness is pardonable. But a play-it-safe approach seemed unnecessarily risky against an omnipresent juggernaut like Trump. The Republican nominee’s campaign depends upon free media. In many ways, what Trump says or does with his airtime is irrelevant – the point is to be seen and heard. He can lie and distort with impunity; his supporters don’t care and he dominates headlines all the same.With that in mind, I suggested Clinton’s plan to lay low and let surrogates do her bidding was a bad idea, and that she ought to steal the spotlight from Trump whenever and wherever she can. The same, I reasoned, was true for Democrats and down-ballot races.Democrats still shouldn’t take anything for granted, but I no longer believe there’s any reason to compete with Trump for airtime. If we’ve learned anything in the last couple of weeks, it’s that Trump will never morph into a sane, pragmatic candidate. He was never going to conform to political norms, but one assumed he would tone it down a bit as we approached November. Instead, he’s quadruple downed on his racist comments about a Mexican-American judge and, more recently, accused President Obama of being a Muslim Manchurian candidate who may or may not be complicit in the recent terror attacks in Orlando.Now that Trump is speaking to a general electorate, he’s paying a higher price for his racist drivel. Indeed, the latest NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll finds Hillary Clinton now leading Donald Trump nationally by eight points (49 percent to 41 percent). This gap will grow as Democrats unify and the Republican nominee continues unraveling in public. Even the political press is challenging Trump in ways that appear to have stunted his momentum.According to a Politico report, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid is now encouraging Democratic senate candidates to sit back and watch Trump discredit himself and everyone associated with him, including GOP candidates who’ve endorsed him. It’s a time-tested strategy: When your enemy is imploding, let him. And that’s what Democrats are doing. Calling it a “shock and blah campaign,” Politico reporter Burgess Everett writes: “The blah comes from the Democratic candidates themselves…They’re intentionally playing it safe and boring, figuring their elections will mostly be a referendum on Trump and that animosity toward the real estate magnate will put them over the top in key swing states.” To the extent that Democrats are attacking at all, they’re keeping it simple. Every interview, every question, and every speech returns to a common theme: Look who’s at the top of the Republican ticket? Is this what the GOP stands for? Is this a candidate Republicans are willing to co-sign? “If there was ever a national election,” said Dem. Senator Chuck Schumer, “This is it.” Trump’s campaign is a dumpster fire riding a wave of nativist angst. Why not make every race on the ballot a referendum on him? What works for Democratic senate candidates will also work for Hillary Clinton. There are obvious differences between senate races and a presidential contest, but the general strategy ought to work in both domains. Clinton will have to face the cameras and engage much more than down-ballot candidates. However, if this is who Trump is going to be, then merely looking and sounding like an adult will be enough for Clinton.","Convert the article into a mystery or detective story, building suspense around the events described.","The Republican nominee, Donald Trump, had ignited a firestorm of controversy with his incendiary rhetoric and divisive policies.

Those ties have some liberals questioning whether Schumer should lead the party, but Reid said that Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would serve as the torch bearers for the populist wing and hold the caucus's feet to the fire.Of his own decision, Reid said he did not want to win another term and grow old in office, saying he wanted to be remembered for his ""first 34 years"" in Congress and not the last few years.A devout baseball fan, Reid said he never wanted to grow old and not be a real force in the Senate.

"(CNN) Donald Trump is ratcheting up his rhetoric about American Muslims, saying there's precedent for monitoring some mosques amid the recent terror wave.At a Birmingham, Alabama, rally on Saturday -- which included a physical altercation between a black protester and several white Trump backers -- the 2016 Republican front-runner suggested law enforcement keep an eye on certain Islamic houses of worship which, in his view, could pose terrorist threats.""I want surveillance of certain mosques if that's OK,"" Trump told the often-raucous and approving crowd. ""We've had it before.""The remarks echo a call Trump made earlier in the week, when he said on MSNBC he'd ""strongly consider"" shutting down mosques in the U.S.The billionaire businessman also linked current terrorist concerns, after the Paris carnage and other attacks, with 9/11.""I watched the World Trade Center go down,"" Trump asserted, adding he watched in New Jersey, ""as thousands of people were cheering as the building was coming down.""Trump then denounced calls to resettle Syrian refuges on U.S. soil, which his Republican rivals for the nomination also oppose.""I want surveillance. I will absolutely take (a) database on the people coming in from Syria. ""If we can't stop it -- but we are going to if I win -- they're going back.""Several attendees at the rally punched and kicked a protester who tried to disrupt Trump's speech.At least a half-dozen attendees shoved and tackled the protester, a black man, to the ground as he refused to leave the event. At least one man punched the protester and a woman kicked him while he was on the ground.All of the attendees who were involved in the physical altercation with the protester were white.The protester appeared to be shouting ""black lives matter"" and later removed his sweatshirt to reveal a shirt with those words.At least one attendee shouted ""all lives matter"" as the protester was eventually led out by police officers on the scene.Birmingham Police Lt. Sean Edwards told CNN that three people were asked to leave the event following the scuffle. No arrests were made, and the protester did not require medical attention.Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks told CNN that ""the campaign does not condone this behavior.""Trump has fended off criticism recently that he was accused of backing a U.S. database on all Muslims in the country. Trump has denied making that remark but hasn't dismissed the idea out-of-hand.The database controversy began Thursday when Trump told Yahoo News that he would create new anti-terrorism measures if he's elected.""We're going to have to do things that we never did before. And some people are going to be upset about it, but I think that now everybody is feeling that security is going to rule,"" he told Yahoo News. ""And certain things will be done that we never thought would happen in this country in terms of information and learning about the enemy. And so we're going to have to do certain things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago.""The Yahoo reporter asked about the possibility of a database for Muslims or ""a form of special identification that noted their religion."" Trump did not say no to either idea. Then, after an Iowa campaign event later that day, an NBC reporter asked Trump if he favored a database to track Muslims in the country. Trump responded in a way some took as backing that idea.At Saturday's rally in Alabama, Trump said he decided not to answer once he heard the reporter identified as being with NBC News.","Convert the article into a survival guide, using the events or information as a backdrop for survival tips.","The recent terror wave has unfortunately brought to light the need for caution and vigilance in our society.

"State officials announced major water cutbacks for Northern California farmers Friday, a historic step that could challenge claims the agriculture industry is getting a free pass during the state's epic drought.The cutbacks will affect some of California's oldest water rights holders — farmers who laid claim to surface water more than a century ago — for the first time in four decades. They will not be allowed to draw water from the San Joaquin River, the Sacramento River and the delta that forms where the two rivers meet. State officials said the rivers simply don't have enough water to meet the demands of all rights holders.This isn't the first time during the current drought that state has cut off supplies to surface water users, including farmers. The water board has already ""curtailed"" nearly 9,000 water rights this year, all of them ""junior"" water rights that were established post-1914.But for the first time since a severe drought in the late 1970s, California is starting to tell ""senior"" water rights holders, who laid claim to surface water before 1914, that there just isn't enough water for them. The cutbacks announced Friday impact rights holders who established their claims between 1903 and 1914.And more historic cuts could be coming over the summer. The State Water Resources Control Board said Friday that it's continuing to monitor conditions in watersheds across the state, and that cutbacks could be on the horizon for even more senior rights holders.""Curtailment notices for other watersheds and for more senior water right holders in these watersheds may be imminent,"" the water board said in a statement.State officials said in a conference call that the water rights being curtailed comprise 1.2 million acre-feet, but it's unclear whether the cutbacks will save quite that much. The water board has indicated in recent months that curtailments for senior rights holders were coming, leading some farmers to store extra water in preparation.Sammy Roth writes about energy and water for The Desert Sun.

"One of the big successes in US policing over the past three decades was the push to make law enforcement more data-driven. The big crime-tracking system that came out of this, CompStat, has been widely credited with helping cut crime in the US.But what if this approach has also led police to be too focused on data, turning policing into a numbers game in which cops try to make as many arrests as possible and manipulate the figures to look good?John Eterno, a retired New York City Police Department captain and associate dean and director of graduate studies in criminal justice at Molloy College, explained the problem in a new documentary by FiveThirtyEight:Initially, I think it was easier to bring down crime, because crime was so high. It's kind of like squeezing a lemon — when you squeeze a lemon, the juice is easy to come out initially. But over time, it's more and more difficult.… Commanders are under enormous pressures to make sure that the crime numbers go down. And then the message filters down to the lower rank: If the captain's not doing well, or the inspector's not doing well, we're not doing well.This creates a perverse incentive at some police departments to make crime and policing numbers look favorable to the department at almost any cost. Officers could achieve this by, for example, purposely misinterpreting some crimes as non-serious offenses or not counting them altogether. That way, the mayor and police chief can claim that serious crimes are dropping when, in reality, some serious offenses are just being defined as non-serious or not counted at all.The numbers game also increases demand on cops to look like they're doing more to prevent crime. So officers are sometimes encouraged to stop or arrest as many people as possible so they can appear as if they're staying busy while on duty.And if some cops don't play along, commanders will try to make their lives harder — by, for instance, putting them on the graveyard shift or denying them promotions. Or, in one whistleblower's case, something much worse.The numbers game became a huge focus for the NYPD over the past few decades. And when officer Adrian Schoolcraft tried to expose the abuse, the NYPD retaliated — placing Schoolcraft in a psychiatric institution against his will for six days.Schoolcraft used a tape recorder to capture several examples of officers massaging the numbers at the NYPD. Here are some examples:But Schoolcraft's colleagues found out what he was up to. One day, when he got off work early, an emergency service unit came to his apartment, abducted him, and forcibly admitted him to a psychiatric ward.As they detained him, police discovered the recorder in Schoolcraft's pocket. One high-ranking official, Deputy Chief Michael Marino, couldn't believe it. ""Absolutely amazing,"" he said, according to the recording. ""When I came on the job, a cop would never dream of doing that to another cop for all the money in the world.""Schoolcraft later got the recordings to the Village Voice, a news weekly that broke the story. He is now suing the hospital that held him, as well as New York City and the NYPD.The story shows just how deeply ingrained the numbers game can be in some police departments: Officers are willing to take down their peers and sometimes friends just to avoid getting caught.""I believe they couldn't afford to have someone expose the behavior so bad, so criminal it would threaten their careers,"" Schoolcraft told New York City's ABC 7 in 2010. ""They reacted out of fear.""","Reframe the text as a pilot's log, navigating through the events or ideas as if on a journey.","The log of my journey through the realm of data-driven policing reveals a tale of unintended consequences and a disturbing numbers game. The push to make law enforcement more data-driven, once a commendable endeavor, has led to a situation where the pursuit of numbers overshadows the core principles of justice and integrity.The CompStat system, a testament to this approach, has been hailed for its crime-reduction prowess.

"WASHINGTON -- While the Obama administration's decision to designate ISIS's atrocities against Christians and other minorities as ""genocide"" is important, many warn that it's only the beginning of the process.""In my judgment Daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in territory under its control,"" Kerry said, using the Arabic acronym for the jihadist army.It's a critical first step towards protecting Christians from ISIS and other Islamic radicals in Iraq and Syria.""Every jihadist in the Middle East believes they can kill, kidnap, enslave and otherwise torture Christians and other religious minorities and they believe they can do it without repercussions,"" said Johnnie Moore, author of the book Defying ISIS.In northern Iraq, Assyrian Christians are an ancient people descended from the first followers of Christ.""As Assyrians of the Middle East we are on the verge of extinction,"" warned Juliana Taimoorazy, founder and president of the Iraqi Christian Relief Council, an organization that raises awareness about the persecuted Church in Iraq.Taimoorazy recently visited Telskuf in the Nineveh Plains of Iraq, where 200,000 Christians have fled from ISIS.""The homes are destroyed when you walk inside,"" she said. ""Their closets are all broken, the beds are all overturned - the kitchens are destroyed.""Secretary Kerry's genocide designation helps keep the plight of these Christians near the front of U.S. foreign policy.Advocates wasted no time celebrating. They're already working with the State Department to ensure Christians are represented in Syrian peace talks and that property rights for those forced to flee their homes in Iraq are enforced.""There are going to be borders redrawn, constitutions redrafted,"" Nina Shea, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, told CBN News.""It's absolutely essential that the Christians have a voice in this process or they will have no place in the new Syria or in the new Iraq,"" she warned.There's already an effort to create a safe haven in the Nineveh Plains so that Christians, Yazidis and other minorities can return home, govern themselves and rebuild their lives without fear of extermination.""If you care about the presence of Christianity, the Christian witness, in this very Gospel poor part of the world you will support the idea of a safe haven,"" Robert Nicholson, executive director of the Philos Project, told CBN News.In spite of the horrors they've experienced at the hands of ISIS, Christians in this part of the world are experiencing a revival of their faith.""They have told me repeatedly it's because of persecution that has been inflicted on them that they have grown closer to Christ that they find themselves praying more that they're thirsty for the Gospel more,"" Taimoorazy said.Now the same advocates who pushed for the genocide designation are moving to keep up the pressure, hoping to ensure the Obama administration not only talks, but acts to protect those persecuted Christians and other religious minorities.They hope to make real progress before the next administration moves into the White House.","Convert the article into a mystery or detective story, building suspense around the events described.","The once vibrant town was now a ghost town, its streets eerily empty.

"And they are looking for someone who could appeal to - or at least not offend - Hispanics, non-white women and other parts of the electorate that went big for Obama and Democrats last year.That's why, just four months into Obama's second term, Paul is part of a stampede of Republican would-be contenders who are criss-crossing the country meeting voters, recruiting potential donors and currying favor with local politicians who could help determine their fate in a run for the White House.The lessons of Romney's bitter loss in November are never far away. On Monday, Paul made jokes about neighboring (and more liberal) Massachusetts and chided leading Democrat Hillary Clinton.

"Why Negotiators At Paris Climate Talks Are Tossing The Kyoto ModelNegotiators and heads of state from nearly 200 countries are meeting for the next two weeks near Paris to craft a new treaty to slow global warming.It's the 21st ""Conference of the Parties"" held by the United Nations to tackle climate change. One treaty emerged, in 1997, after the conference in Kyoto, Japan. That's no longer in effect, and, in fact, the Kyoto Protocol, as it's known, didn't slow down the gradual warming of the planet.Now governments are ever more desperate to do something to slow warming — so much so that they've thrown out the model set in Kyoto and opted for a new approach for Paris.Valli Moosa, a former climate negotiator from South Africa, says the main reason Kyoto failed to slow warming lies largely with who wasn't included in the treaty. ""You actually cannot have a meaningful agreement without China and the United States being part of it,"" he says.The U.S. Senate refused to ratify the Kyoto treaty, so the world's biggest greenhouse-gas emitter didn't have skin in the game. And developing countries, including China and India, were not required to reduce emissions. Now those countries are becoming the biggest sources of greenhouse gases as their economies thrive. China, in fact, is now the world's biggest emitter, and India isn't far behind. Moreover, the Kyoto treaty had U.N. bureaucrats and negotiators setting goals for the participating countries to lower their greenhouse gases. Many countries didn't make their targets; others dropped out. Economies were at stake, and few countries were comfortable marching to a U.N. beat.So what negotiators are bringing to the table at the Paris talks is an arrangement whereby each country is offering to reduce its own emissions by whatever amount it can manage. And everybody participates, not just developed countries.Most nations arrive with a reduction target already in hand. What will be difficult is deciding who will pay how much to developing countries to build economies that won't keep producing high emissions.French negotiator Laurence Tubiana points out that the key to success is convincing governments that those economies can be ""low-carbon,"" and that this won't be a bar to developing wealth. ""How much I'm sacrificing for the sake of emissions reductions, that's no more,"" she says of the message that negotiators are pushing. ""And now ... the Chinese, even the Indians are really coming in. It's about low-carbon economy.""Previous attempts to replace the Kyoto treaty have failed. This new approach is voluntary, and most of the world has agreed theoretically to participate, which negotiators hope will sweeten things enough to get a deal. Still to be determined, however, is who will pay for this massive revolution in the world's energy economy, and what strings will be attached to their largesse.","Develop as a script for a 5-minute documentary, including narrator lines and interview quotes.","One such treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, emerged in 1997 but failed to slow down the gradual warming of the planet.Valli Moosa, a former climate negotiator from South Africa, explains the main reason for Kyoto's failure.

"President Obama on Tuesday followed through on his vow to veto bipartisan-backed legislation authorizing the Keystone XL pipeline, marking his first veto of the Republican-led Congress and only the third of his presidency.The president, in a brief statement, claimed the bill would ""circumvent"" the existing process for reviewing the pipeline, which would extend from Canada to Texas.""The Presidential power to veto legislation is one I take seriously,"" Obama said. ""But I also take seriously my responsibility to the American people. And because this act of Congress conflicts with established executive branch procedures and cuts short thorough consideration of issues that could bear on our national interest -- including our security, safety, and environment -- it has earned my veto.""The decision, while expected, was met with tough criticism from Republicans -- and tees up another showdown with Congress in the coming days as GOP leaders try to override.""It's extremely disappointing that President Obama vetoed a bipartisan bill that would support thousands of good jobs and pump billions of dollars into the economy,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement. ""Even though the President has yielded to powerful special interests, this veto doesn't end the debate.""McConnell's office said the Senate plans to vote on overriding sometime before March 3.But so far, congressional leaders have not demonstrated they have the votes to override, which takes a two-thirds majority in both chambers.The Keystone bill garnered 62 yeas in the Senate, but they would need 67 to override. In the House, the bill got 270 votes -- but they would need 281 to override.It remains unclear whether moderate lawmakers could be swayed to switch in the coming weeks.While Tuesday's veto marked only the third of Obama's presidency -- fewer than any U.S. president since the 19th century -- his sparing use of the presidential tool is likely to change. With Republicans now in control of Congress, their efforts to chip away at the president's health care law and other legislative accomplishments are just as likely to be met with Obama's veto pen.To date, Obama rarely has used the veto in part because Democrats for six years controlled at least one chamber in Congress -- acting as a buffer to prevent unwanted bills from ever reaching the president's desk. That buffer is now gone.A look back at past presidencies, especially where control of the White House and Congress was split during at least one point, shows far more liberal use of that presidential power.In the Clinton presidency, the president issued 37 vetoes in his two terms. President Ronald Reagan issued 78. President George W. Bush issued 12. His father issued 44.Not since the Warren G. Harding administration has the number of vetoes been in the single digits; Harding issued six.The Keystone bill is as contentious an issue as any for Obama to fire his first veto shot of the new Congress.First proposed in 2008, the Keystone pipeline would connect Canada's tar sands to Gulf Coast refineries.The White House has said repeatedly it would wait to make its decision about whether to let the project go forward until after a State Department review. It regards the legislation as circumventing that process.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",Summarize the article as a catchy song lyric.,"(Verse 1)President Obama vetoed the bill,Keystone XL, a bitter pill.The process would be circumvented,Jobs lost, the economy sprouted.(Chorus)Vetoed, vetoed, the bill,A fight for jobs and the environment too.The battle rages on,As Congress tries to override.(Verse 2)McConnell's office said they'll vote"

"Speaking from Hiroshima, the site of the first war-time atomic weapon detonation, President Obama on Friday called for the pursuit of ""a world without nuclear weapons.""Only a few days prior, his Department of Defense published new data revealing that the government Obama oversees -- a government which manages the second-largest nuclear stockpile in the world -- had dismantled fewer of its nuclear devices than in any year since at least 1980.Every year, the Department of Defense declassifies data on the size of the country's nuclear stockpile and the number of warheads dismantled. Its most recent data, released this week, shows that the U.S. stockpile numbered 4,571 at the end of 2015, about 15 percent of its size at its peak during the Cold War in 1967. The number of weapons dismantled was 109, the lowest figure since at least 1980.In 1945, the size of the stockpile matched the number of weapons deployed -- two. The biggest reductions came in the early 1990s during the administration of George H.W. Bush and, a decade later, during his son's. At the end of 2008, the stockpile numbered 5,273; over the course of Obama's two terms, it has dropped to 4,571.It is, of course, easier to reduce the size of a stockpile when it is much larger. As a fraction of the total weapon count, Obama has sliced the total by a bit more than one-tenth -- 13 percent. But the Federation of American Scientists is still critical of Obama's progress in this regard. That 13 percent is ""the smallest reduction of the stockpile achieved by any previous post-Cold War administration;"" the 109 dismantlings last year continues ""a trendline of fewer and fewer warheads dismantled"" under Obama. The FAS notes that there are reasons outside of the administration's control for the lower number last year -- but also that political pressure discourages a push for reduction.Why does the size of our stockpile matter? As data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows, the United States still controls about half of the weapons controlled by recognized nuclear states.","Convert the article into a mystery or detective story, building suspense around the events described.","The city of Hiroshima, steeped in the somber history of the first war-time atomic weapon detonation, echoed with President Obama's call for a world without nuclear weapons.

"Republican Donald Trump appears to have carved out a wider path to the White House as a number of states including Florida and Ohio are no longer considered likely wins for Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project released on Saturday.The project, which combines opinion polls with an analysis of voting patterns under different election scenarios, still shows Clinton would have the best chance of winning the presidency if the Nov. 8 election were held today. Yet Trump has caught up to her level of support in several states.Clinton now has an 83 percent chance of winning the election by an average of 47 votes in the Electoral College, the body that ultimately selects the president. In late August, the States of the Nation estimated that Clinton had a 95 percent chance of winning by an average of 108 electoral votes.Over the past few weeks, Clinton's lead in the national polls has slipped considerably. Polls tend to narrow as Election Day nears, and the Clinton campaign has struggled to overcome controversy about how she handled classified information while serving as secretary of state.A separate Reuters/Ipsos poll of likely voters showed an 8-point lead for Clinton has vanished since the last week of August.Clinton is still favored to win 17 states, including many with large, urban populations such as New York, New Jersey and California that heavily influence the outcome of the election. Trump would likely win 23 states, many of them with smaller populations.The number of states projected for Clinton has dropped over the past few weeks. Two of those states, Ohio and Florida, were considered likely wins for Clinton in late August. Now the candidates are about even in support. Five more states, including Michigan and North Carolina are also up for grabs.The sample size was insufficient to determine the outcome in Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska and the District of Columbia, though Alaska usually votes Republican and Washington D.C. for the Democratic Party candidate.The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project is driven by an online survey that gathers responses from about 15,000 people per week. Their responses are weighted according to the latest population estimates, and each respondent is ranked according to their likelihood to vote.Once the poll is complete, the project tallies the levels of support and estimated error for both candidates, and then runs multiple election simulations given their respective support.","Convert the article into a lesson plan, outlining educational activities based on the content.",****Lesson Plan****Subject:** Government and Politics**Grade Level:** 9-12**Time:** 45 minutes**Learning Objectives:*** Students will be able to summarize the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project.* Students will be able to explain the impact of the project on the presidential election.* Students will be able to discuss the challenges facing Clinton and Trump in the election.**Materials

""Moore knowingly ordered [probate judges] to commit violations...knowingly subjecting them to potential prosecution and removal from office.""Moore said in a statement that the commission has no authority over administrative orders or the court's ability to prohibit probate judges from issuing same-sex marriage licenses.""We intend to fight this agenda vigorously and expect to prevail,"" he said.Moore wrote in his order that the U.S. Supreme Court ruling was at odds with a decision in March 2015 by the Alabama Supreme Court that instructed probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.The conflicting opinions had resulted in ""confusion and uncertainty,"" Moore said, with many probate judges issuing marriage licenses to gay couples while others refused to do so.Until the Alabama Supreme Court decides the matter, probate judges ""have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license,"" he said.The complaint said Moore's order ""was contrary to clear and determined law about which there is no confusion or unsettled question.""Moore, a Republican, has been a hero of conservative causes before.

"St. Louis County Police announced on Sunday that they had made an arrest related to the two officers who were shot during a protest on Thursday in Ferguson, Missouri.St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch announced that authorities had brought charges, including assault in the first degree, against 20-year-old Jeffrey Williams. Williams is from the St. Louis area and had been on probation for receiving stolen property.Williams had been involved in protests on the evening that the shooting occurred and had ""acknowledged"" firing shots, according to McCulloch. McCulloch said that Williams, who is African-American, may have been firing at someone other than the police.""We don't know him,"" said Tony Rice, the founder of Ground Level Support, who has been protesting since AugustAfter naming three young male protesters who were regularly at the demonstrations, Rice told HuffPost, ""I don't think there is a male 20-years-old that regularly protest outside of them.""""I think I can speak for the protester community in saying we don't know him,"" said Rice.After the press conference, press swarmed Alicia Street when she helped source the first picture of Williams.

I cannot recall that I even seen him that night. We know a lot of people out there, we really do. I even showed pictures to other regular protesters and they said they didn't know him,"" Street told HuffPost.The shooting came during protests after Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson announced that he would resign.

"Kim Davis — the Rowan County, Kentucky Clerk who earlier today brazenly defied the Supreme Court’s order to issue marriage licenses citing “God’s authority” — has been ordered to stand before U.S. District Judge David Bunning on Thursday and explain why she shouldn’t be jailed and fined for her actions.In a statement released after she refused, for the fourth time, to issue David Moore and David Ermold a marriage license, Davis said that “[t]o issue a marriage license which conflicts with God’s definition of marriage, with my name affixed to the certificate, would violate my conscience. It is not a light issue for me. It is a Heaven or Hell decision.”“I was elected by the people to serve as the County Clerk,” she continued, and “I intend to continue to serve the people of Rowan County, but I cannot violate my conscience.” That she is an elected official has become a point of contention, because as such she can’t be fired for refusing to abide by the Supreme Court’s ruling. Removing her from office would entail impeachment proceedings, which will either have to wait until the next legislative session or require the calling of a special session, which could be prohibitively expensive.In the meantime, no one in Rowan County will be issued a marriage licenses. Lawyers representing the four couples who were denied licenses told the Associated Press that “[s]ince Defendant Davis continues to collect compensation from the Commonwealth for duties she fails to perform,” they want Judge Bunning to “impose financial penalties sufficiently serious and increasingly onerous” — but that they are not seeking for her to be jailed for contempt. The scene at Davis’ office this morning was raucous, with supporters of both side lining the walkway into it and occupying the tiny building. “Praise the Lord!” yelled one, “Stand your ground!” Another demanded Davis “Do your job!” One of her supporters was her husband, who noted that his family has received death threats and warned people that he’s a firm believer in the Second Amendment. “I’m an old redneck hillbilly,” he warned. “That’s all I’ve got to say. Don’t come knocking on my door.” Watch video via the Courier-Journal below.",Reframe the article to focus on future implications and predictions based on the events or information presented.,"The current situation stems from the Supreme Court's ruling on marriage equality, which was met with resistance by Kim Davis, the county clerk.

"That was President Barack Obama's message to American consumers on Tuesday as he discussed near six year-low gas prices in an interview with The Detroit News ahead of a visit to Michigan on Wednesday to tout the recovery of the auto industry and the growth of American manufacturing.""I would strongly advise American consumers to continue to think about how you save money at the pump because it is good for the environment, it's good for family pocketbooks and if you go back to old habits and suddenly gas is back at $3.50, you are going to not be real happy,"" Obama said.But instead of returning to ""old habits,"" Obama advised Americans to save their money, ""or better yet"" use the savings to buy a new car, for example.He said Americans should ""not believe that"" gas prices won't rise again, explaining that demand for oil in booming countries like China and India will continue to rise, kicking costs back up. Oil prices have dropped more than 50% in recent months, falling below $50 a barrel for the first time since 2009 on Monday. Many members of Congress are counting on gas prices to remain low, however, as they hope to use the low prices as an opportunity to increase the gas tax for the first time in more than two decades. As he touts the results of his bailout of the auto industry on Wednesday, Obama will also promote fuel efficiency at the Ford plant he is set to visit, which produces alternative fuel vehicles and small cars, The News reported. Obama gave the newspaper a preview of his speech Wednesday, in which he is expected to tout the resurgence of the auto industry and the boom of American manufacturing -- two key points of his plan for economic recovery, and elements he hopes will become a part of his legacy as president. ""The auto industry has led a resurgence of manufacturing in America,"" Obama said. ""The quality of the cars has gotten so much better that we are competitive — not just in SUVs — but up and down the line. The branding of American cars is back to where it should be.

"Obama Looking For Justice Who Will 'Interpret' The Law, Not 'Make' ItThe legal world has a new blogger: former constitutional law professor and current President Barack Obama.The president took to SCOTUSblog, the leading online chronicle of the Supreme Court, on Wednesday to offer some ""spoiler-free insights"" into what he is seeking in a justice to replace the late Antonin Scalia.Aside from ""mastery of the law,"" Obama said he wants to choose a nominee who understands ""a judge's job is to interpret the law, not make the law."" But in cases where the law's unclear, the president wrote, he will look for ""the kind of life experience learned outside the classroom and the courtroom; experience that suggests he or she views the law not only as an intellectual exercise, but also grasps the way it affects the daily reality of people's lives in a big, complicated democracy, and in rapidly changing times.""And, about those times: Senate Republicans signaled this week they will take no action on whomever the White House nominates. All 11 GOP members of the Judiciary Committee signed a letter Tuesday saying they would not give their consent under the Constitution. The lawmakers said they did not intend to even meet with the nominee, let alone hold a public hearing on his or her qualifications.On Wednesday, President Obama blasted the politics of the Senate, and said the American people would have the chance to judge his nominee — something of a public relations campaign.""My hope an expectation is that once there is an actual nominee... that those on the judiciary committee recognize that their job is to give this person a hearing, to show the courtesy of meeting with them. They are then free to vote whatever their conscience dictates.""""I'm going to do my job, I'm going to nominate someone,"" he continued, ""and let the American people decide as to whether that person is qualified.""That means the court could operate without a full complement of nine members for a year or more, the equivalent of two terms of the Supreme Court. At least one current justice, Samuel Alito, commented on that, telling an audience at Georgetown Law school this week, ""We will deal with it.""""There's nothing in the Constitution that specifies the size of the Supreme Court,"" Alito said. ""There were times in the history of the court when the court had an even number of justices. They must have been more agreeable in those days.""",Summarize the article as a catchy song lyric.,"(Verse 1)Obama's on the blog,Sharing his thoughts on the law,He's looking for a judge,To interpret, not make,And he wants someone bright,With mastery of the law,But also someone who can,Interpret, not make,And understand the times,And the changing world,And the people's lives.(Chorus)So Obama's going"
"President Obama has long been a friend of organized labor, wholeheartedly supported by unions that helped boost him to victory in both his presidential campaigns.But increasingly, there now is a divide between unions in the public and private sector when it comes to supporting him.According to James Sherk, a labor policy analyst with the Heritage Foundation, government employee unions want ""bigger and more expensive government,"" in contrast to private sector unions.Sherk added those private groups are ""pushing back"" and speaking out more publicly about things like the Keystone XL Pipeline, which they believe will benefit their members. That has put them on a collision course with Obama, who last summer proclaimed, ""We should do everything we can to strengthen unions in this country.""""The president's insistence on vetoing this pipeline is directly taking away income from these union members, and they, understandably, don't like it,"" Sherk said.Congress has passed a measure to expedite the Keystone project, although Obama has vowed to veto it. Just days ago, Sean McGarvey, president of North America's Building Trades Unions, made a direct appeal.""We urge the president of the United States to put our men and women back to work across the length of this pipeline as soon as possible,"" McGarvey said, adding, ""We urge the president to sign the bill.""Union leaders also have a long-standing beef with the administration over the Affordable Care Act's enormous tax on so-called Cadillac health insurance plans.The plans offer high dollar benefits and are used as a recruiting tool.Although the tax doesn't kick in for several more years, as far back as 2013 union leaders were making public pleas to Democratic lawmakers. In a letter written in July of that year, union officials, including James Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, urged congressional Democrats to drop the tax saying, ""We voted for you.We have a problem; you need to fix it.""Analysts say the issue may present an opportunity for GOP leaders to build some good will with unions. Just days ago, Rep. Frank Guinta, R-N.H., introduced a measure he's calling ""Ax the Tax.""A similar measure didn't get far in the Senate last year, but may have a better chance with the GOP now in control of both the House and Senate.","Rewrite the text as a codex or ancient scroll, giving it a historical or mystical aura.","In the ancient scroll of the Union's tale, a tale etched in the annals of time, a tale of a divide and a plight, a tale of a president and a union's plight, a tale of a battle for the heart of a nation.Long has President Obama, a champion of the labor, been a friend to the unions, a man of unwavering support, a man who rode the wave of union strength to victory in both his campaigns."

"THE STING videos targeting Planned Parenthood are hard to watch. Doctors talk clinically, some say callously, about harvesting fetal tissue. Technicians identify and isolate tiny organs. References are made to “it’s a baby” or “it’s another boy.” The videos were taken surreptitiously and were artfully edited to produce maximum discomfort about complicated issues that, for many, are inherently uncomfortable.That truths were distorted to paint an inaccurate and unfair picture of a health organization that provides valuable services to women — as well as to demonize research that leads to important medical advances — doesn’t matter to antiabortion activists. Or, sadly, to the politicians who pander to them.Planned Parenthood is under virulent attack for the role a small portion of its affiliates play in helping women who want to donate fetal tissue for medical research. The antiabortion group Center for Medical Progress has orchestrated a propaganda campaign accusing the nation’s largest provider of abortions of profiting from the illegal sale of fetal tissue, a charge refuted by Planned Parenthood.None of the videos released shows anything illegal and, in fact, the full footage of Planned Parenthood executives meeting with people presumed to be buyers for a human biologics company include repeated assertions that clinics are not selling tissue but only seeking permitted reimbursement costs for expenses. Indeed, the Colorado clinic featured in the videos refused to enter into a contract with the phony company because of its failure to meet its legal and ethical standards.Such facts, though, haven’t stopped officials in several Republican-led states, including Texas, Louisiana and Ohio, from launching investigations of Planned Parenthood, even though affiliates in those states don’t facilitate fetal tissue donations. In Washington, Senate Republicans have fast-tracked a bid to defund Planned Parenthood, with a vote set for Monday. Fortunately, it’s unlikely there will be 60 votes to advance the bill, as cutting off funds to Planned Parenthood would be irresponsible.No federal money is used by Planned Parenthood to provide abortions except in some rare exceptions. So cutting off government funds, mostly through Medicaid and grants, would only hurt the thousands of people, most of them low-income women, who each day depend upon Planned Parenthood for birth control, cancer screenings, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and other health services. Given that many of the clinics are in medically underserved areas, it’s a myth, as Republicans claim, that other providers can fill the gap. Shutting down clinics would make it harder for many women to obtain birth control — and the last thing either side of the abortion debate should want is an increase in unwanted pregnancies that result in more abortions.We are under no illusions that the vendetta against Planned Parenthood will end. Conservative Republicans are already threatening to shut down the federal government in the fall by blocking any spending that includes money for Planned Parenthood. It’s clear from how quickly Republican presidential hopefuls seized on the issue that it will be a staple of the campaign trail. Consequently, it’s important that congressional Democrats and others continue to stand up for Planned Parenthood and the women whose health depends upon its services.","Translate the article into a poetic format, capturing the essence and emotions of the story.","Fetal tissue, a controversial plight,The subject of a battle, day and night.Doctors speak in clinical tone,But emotions linger, a heavy load.Tiny organs isolated with care,The pain of loss, a silent prayer.The videos were taken surreptitiously,Edited to cause discomfort and misery.A distorted picture,"
"North Charleston Police Officer Michael T. Slager, 33, can be seen shooting 50-year-old Walter Scott after a confrontation on Saturday, according to The Post and Courier. Slager chases Scott and shoots at him eight times in the video recorded by a passerby and obtained by The New York Times.The confrontation started when Slager had reportedly pulled over Scott because of a broken taillight. It escalated into a foot chase as Scott allegedly fled because there were family court-issued warrants for his arrest. Slager pursued Scott into a grassy lot and claimed that he fired his Taser to subdue him.Earlier this week, an attorney for Slager said the cop felt threatened after Scott tried to overpower him and take his Taser. Today that attorney told The Post and Courier that he's ""no longer involved"" in the case.But first images in the video are of Slager shooting at Scott as he runs away from him. It also appears that Slager drops the Taser near Scott after he was gunned down, according to The New York Times.Police reports also say that responding officers performed CPR and delivered medical aid to Scott, but the video shows Scott face down in handcuffs for several minutes after the shooting. Another officer shows up and appears to give Scott aid, but never performs CPR.Police Chief Eddie Driggers said Tuesday that Slager had been arrested. The U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement that FBI investigators would work with the State Law Enforcement Division, which typically investigates officer-involved shootings in South Carolina, and the state’s attorney general to investigate any civil rights violations in Scott’s death. Mayor Keith Summey added during a news conference that as a result of the video and Slager’s “bad decision,” the officer would be charged with murder.Scott had been arrested about 10 times in the past, mostly for failing to pay child support or show up for hearings, according to the paper.""He has four children, he doesn’t have some type of big violent past or arrest record. He had a job, he was engaged,"" a lawyer for Scott's family told the Times. ""He had back child support and didn’t want to go to jail for back child support.""In a statement released Tuesday night, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley (R) said, ""What happened in this case is not acceptable in South Carolina."" Senator Tim Scott (R) said ""The senseless shooting and taking of Walter Scott's life was absolutely unnecessary and avoidable,"" adding that he would be watching the case closely.The shooting in North Charleston comes on the heels of several high-profile cases of police officers using deadly force against unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, Cleveland and New York. This is one of the few times the offending officer has been charged with murder.""What if there was no video? What if there was no witness? Where would we be without that video,"" Justin Bamberg said at a presser with the family on Tuesday night. Bamburg is one of the Scotts' family attorneys and also represents South Carolina's House District 90.Family attorney L. Chris Stewart called the witness who recorded the video a ""hero,"" saying that video evidence disproved initial reports that Scott reached for the Slager's Taser. Stewart added that the witness is working with investigators and may eventually come forward.""If there was no video, I do not believe that officer would be in jail,"" Bamberg said. ""From what the video shows, I think that provides the necessary ammunition to hold this officer accountable.""""I don't think anybody can see that and not see that what that officer did was murder Mr. Scott in cold blood,"" Bamberg said.

"President Barack Obama said the U.S. and its allies must strip away any legitimacy that Islamic State and al-Qaeda claim by portraying themselves as religious movements.Obama, who has come under criticism from Republicans who say he avoids acknowledging the Muslim roots of extremist groups, said terrorists use religion as a recruiting tool by portraying the U.S. and European nations as being at war with Islam.“We must never accept the premise they put forward, because it is a lie,” Obama said Wednesday in Washington on the second day of a White House summit on combating extremism. “They are not religious leaders. They’re terrorists. And we are not at war with Islam. We are at war with people who have perverted Islam.”Deadly attacks in Paris, Sydney and Copenhagen by individuals of Muslim background and possibly inspired by the brutal tactics of Islamic State, along with the group’s spread in Syria, Iraq and now Libya, have raised alarms in Europe and the U.S. about the danger of lone-wolf terrorists, driven by extremist ideology and difficult to detect before they act.At the summit, the Obama administration is convening representatives of Muslim organizations, law enforcement officials and local political leaders to swap ideas about how to stem root causes of extremism. It also has invited leaders from overseas to take part.Obama said civic leaders must recognize that Islamic State and al-Qaeda “deliberately target their propaganda in the hopes of reaching and brainwashing young Muslims” through videos, social media and other online outlets. He said the one way to counter that is to alleviate the alienation and poverty that are the extremists’ best recruiting tool.In the U.S., he said, local and federal authorities must make sure that Muslims aren’t isolated and that they are welcomed and integrated into society.“Muslim Americans feel they have been unfairly targeted,” he said. “We have to be sure that abuses stop, are not repeated, that we do not stigmatize entire communities.”Former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore, who is chairman of a political action committee aimed at electing Republicans, called the conference a “farce” in a statement and said the administration should be targeting terrorists rather than offering “pie-in-the-sky social welfare programs” to Muslims here and overseas.The administration’s strategy is also aimed at drawing in the domestic Muslim leaders who Obama is leaning on to identify and isolate potentially violent extremists. Yet some groups say they remain suspicious about the administration’s motivation.The Muslim Advocates, an Oakland Calif.-based group that that was invited to a White House meeting earlier this month, expressed concern that Obama’s requests for “partnerships” with Muslim community and religious leaders is code for requiring leaders to play a law enforcement role.They also blasted Obama for focusing too narrowly on Muslims, a decision that the group says reinforces a negative stereotype that Islam and terror are linked.“This whole day is focused on American Muslims, frankly,” Farhana Khera, the group’s executive director, said in a telephone interview. “It strikes at the core of what we are as Americans.”Obama is speaking on the topic again tomorrow at the State Department during a session that includes representatives from overseas, including France, Belgium, Mexico and Japan.","Rewrite the text as a detailed review or critique of the events or issues discussed, offering insights and analysis.",President Barack Obama's recent remarks on the U.S. and its allies stripping away any legitimacy that Islamic State and al-Qaeda claim as religious movements have sparked a debate about the nature of extremism and the potential for lone-wolf terrorists.Obama's assertion that terrorists use religion as a recruiting tool is valid. The rise of Islamic State and its use of propaganda to attract followers has been well documented. The group's exploitation of religious grievances and the portrayal
"""Donald Trump is the nominee, whether people like it or not,"" the former House speaker, during a question-and-answer session at a hedge fund conference in Las Vegas, told attendees Thursday. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, made clear he would support the nominee.But that doesn¹t mean Boehner supports what Trump is pitching on the campaign trail. Asked, rapid fire, whether he supported Trump's proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S., his proposal to build a wall on the border of Mexico and the New York billionaire¹s plan to aggressively use tariffs to attack foreign trade competitors, Boehner repeatedly answered with one word: ""No.""He also said Trump¹s foreign policy stance, laid out in a speech two weeks ago, didn't align with his views. Still, Boehner said, ""Anybody who doesn't think Donald Trump can win, just watch.""Boehner¹s comments come two weeks after saying, during a question-and-answer session at Stanford University, that he and Trump were ""texting buddies."" It was at that same event that he called then-GOP presidential candidate and regular Boehner tormenter Ted Cruz, the Texas senator, ""Lucifer in the flesh."" Cruz has since suspended his campaign, clearing the way for Trump to secure the title of ""presumptive nominee"" for the party. Boehner, in an unsolicited comment, couldn't hide his feelings on that front. ""Thank God the guy from Texas didn't win,"" he said. As all eyes in Washington were on Trump¹s meetings with top GOP lawmakers, Boehner weighed in on the decision by his replacement as speaker -- the lawmaker Boehner pushed, lobbied and cajoled to take the job, Paul Ryan -- not to immediately endorse Trump. ""I think Paul was just being cautious,"" Boehner said, adding that he ""doesn't have any doubt"" things will ""get smoothed over.""

"Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon said he will vote to support the Iran nuclear deal, a pledge that puts President Barack Obama only three votes short of protecting the pact in Congress.Merkley issued a statement Sunday calling the accord “the best available strategy to block Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.”Merkley’s support brings to 31 the number of senators publicly favoring the deal, which would ease economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on the country’s nuclear program.Barring defections, Obama needs three more votes from 13 Senate Democrats who have yet to declare their position, to sustain a likely veto of legislation aimed at killing the pact.If Obama can assemble 41 Senate votes by getting most of the remaining Democrats on board, the Senate may not vote on the agreement at all.The Republican-controlled Congress has until Sept. 17 to pass a resolution disapproving the deal reached in July between six world powers and Iran. Obama has pledged to veto that resolution if it gets to his desk.While Republicans have been united in opposing the deal, only two Democratic senators -- Charles Schumer of New York, the third-ranking Democrat in the chamber, and Robert Menendez of New Jersey -- have joined them so far.Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, plans to announce his decision on Tuesday. Among other Democrats yet to disclose a position are Maryland’s Ben Cardin and New Jersey’s Cory Booker.The only uncertain Senate Republican vote is that of Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who remains undecided and is expected to make her decision after Sept. 7.Merkley, in a statement on his website, pledged to vote for the deal even while pointing to “significant shortcomings” that he said the U.S. must address with “a massive intelligence program” and monitoring.Merkley said he was troubled that the deal allows Iran to import conventional arms after five years and ballistic missile technology after eight years, and sets no restrictions on how Iran can use money it reclaims when sanctions are lifted.But he rejected a proposal from deal opponents to try to renegotiate the accord for better terms.If the U.S. rejects the deal and Iran resumes its nuclear program, “the United States would be viewed by the international community as undermining a strong framework for peacefully blocking a potential Iranian bomb,” Merkley said.While the Republican-controlled House has enough votes to pass a resolution rejecting the deal, it’s unclear whether the Senate does. Assuming all 54 Senate Republicans oppose the accord, they would need support from six Democrats to get the 60 votes necessary to advance a resolution.","Convert the article into a script for a short play or skit, highlighting key dialogues and interactions.",** A Senate chamber**Characters:*** Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR)* President Barack Obama* Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY)* Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ)* Senator Chris Coons (D-DE)* Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD)* Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ)* Senator Susan Collins (R-ME)**[The Senate
"Obama To Limit Police Acquisition Of Some Military-Style EquipmentPresident Obama said military-style equipment used by police departments ""can alienate and intimidate local residents and send the wrong message,"" as he ended federal transfers of such weapons to local law enforcement.Obama's remarks, made in Camden, N.J., are an attempt to ease tensions between police and minority communities in the wake of several high-profile police-involved shootings.Under new recommendations, police forces will be banned from acquiring some types of military-style equipment from federal agencies. The proposal was one of several made by a White House task force that Obama is putting into place using an executive order on Monday.According to a report issued by the White House, the task force recommended banning the sale of some equipment — such as tracked armored vehicles, weaponized aircraft and high-caliber weapons and ammunition — after weighing their utility to local police and the ""the potential negative impact on the community if the equipment was used arbitrarily or inappropriately.""Local police departments can still buy this equipment on their own. They just can't buy them from the feds or buy them using federal money.""Obama's visit to one of New Jersey's poorest cities comes as he seeks to ramp up federal funding for community policing initiatives in the wake of a series of high-profile incidents that have frayed trust between officers and residents in Ferguson, Mo., New York and Baltimore, among other cities.

Data scientists will help some police departments polish an early warning system, using data to flag problems.— Twenty-one jurisdictions will also release big data sets that will help ""communities gain visibility into key information on police/citizen encounters.""— The White House will release a body-cam tool kit that will help police plan and implement body-cam programs.— The Department of Justice ""will begin taking applications for grants designed to advance the practice of community policing in law enforcement agencies through hiring, training and technical assistance, the development of innovative community policing strategies, applied research, guidebooks, and best practices that are national in scope.""","Reimagine the article as a speculative fiction story, incorporating futuristic elements or technology.","The futuristic cityscape of Camden, New Jersey, cast long shadows as President Obama stood amidst a crowd of anxious residents.

"Milestone House Vote Would Take Health Care Away From MillionsAfter dozens of votes attacking Obamacare in recent years, House Republicans' latest attempt Tuesday finally gets real.Not in the sense that the full repeal bill will become law — it's not likely to pass the Senate and, in any event, faces a certain presidential veto even if it somehow does. What makes today a milestone is that, for the first time, House Republicans plan to vote on whether to actually take health coverage away from millions of Americans who now have it.More precisely: 19 million of them by the end of the year, according to a recent estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. And with a new study showing that 60 percent of Affordable Care Act beneficiaries receiving subsidies from the federal exchange are from the South and 60 percent of them non-Hispanic whites, House Republicans would be casting votes to eliminate a program that to a large extent benefits their own constituents.How this new reality will affect the vote count is unclear. Republicans have been solid in their opposition to the health care law. The last time the House voted to repeal the law in entirety — rather than tweak one or more small provisions — was May 16, 2013. Not a single Republican voted against it. But that was when the first enrollment period was still months away, and the vote could still largely be framed as a matter of political philosophy.That was also before Republicans picked up 13 Democratic seats in the 2014 midterm elections, some of which are in swing districts that could swing right back to Democrats.One of those new Republicans, in fact, could serve as the poster child for the party's potential problems with the vote: Rep. Carlos Curbelo, who represents the western suburbs of Miami, some of Florida's poorest communities. The majority-Latino district also happens to contain one ZIP code with one of the highest Obamacare enrollments in the country and is blocks away from two others.This could be one reason why Curbelo's Spanish response to President Obama's State of the Union address last month avoided the Affordable Care Act altogether. Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, in the English response, described Obamacare as an example of ""failed policies."" Curbelo, though, spoke instead about education and the income gap — and chided Washington for not working ""toward a health economy that offers opportunities to everyone who lives in this country, not just the most privileged,"" according to a comparison done by the Miami Herald.Other Republicans have recognized for some time that taking away access to health care for the working poor was not necessarily good politics and have advocated a ""repeal and replace"" strategy to show that the GOP also cares about the issue.No Republican alternative to the ACA has yet emerged since the party took control of the House in 2011, and none is in today's bill, either. However, the proposal does instruct three House committees to recommend ideas to replace Obamacare, including such things as limiting medical malpractice lawsuits and giving states more flexibility in administering Medicaid.",Compose the article as an email exchange between characters or parties involved in the events.,"Here's the rewritten text:**From:** Rep.

"SHARM EL-SHEIK, Egypt, March 14 (Reuters) - On the eve of fresh talks with Iran, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said it was unclear whether an interim agreement over its nuclear power program was within reach.""I can't tell you whether or not we can get a deal, whether we are close,"" Kerry told a news conference on Saturday in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik, where he attended an Egyptian investment summit.""The purpose of these negotiations is not just to get a deal, it is to get the right deal,"" he added.The United States and five other major powers -- Britain, Germany, France, China and Russia -- will resume negotiations with Iran in Lausanne, Switzerland, from Sunday.

In exchange, sanctions on the Islamic Republic would gradually end.Kerry expressed concern again that a letter to Iran last week from Republican senators may have undermined the talks.

"In some gas stations around the country, the price of a gallon of regular has dropped below $1.42. AAA and GasBuddy, two organizations that follow gasoline prices, say that gasoline prices below $2 will not be unusual in most of the United States. As oil prices fall, and refinery capacity stays strong, the price of gas could reach $1 a gallon in some areas, a level last reached in 1999. As a matter of fact, the entire states of Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Caroline have gas prices that average at or below $1.75.Gasoline prices are driven mostly by four factors: oil prices, proximity to refineries, refinery capacity and state taxes and levies. Oil prices have dropped below $33 a barrel and continue to collapse. The recent decision by Saudi Arabia to continue to keep its oil exports high essentially has dissolved the OPEC cartel. The decision also has forced the kingdom to chop its 2016 budget. This ongoing supply glut guarantees oversupply of crude. At the same time, slowing national economies in the largest countries, including China, will lower demand. China now tops the list of oil importers, according to the Financial Times, having moved ahead of the United States.The cost of producing oil from shale deposits, particularly in the United States, is greater in some cases than what it can be sold for. Nonetheless, parts of this industry continue pumping, increasing supply, while others go bankrupt because they cannot survive with crude prices so low.Several states house large refineries or are close to those that do. This is particularly the case near the Gulf of Mexico, including the massive refinery operations south of Houston. Some owned by Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) process several hundreds of thousands of barrels per day. Proximity to refineries is a factor in gasoline prices, if the refineries are running at or near capacity and produce gasoline instead of other petroleum products.Finally, gas taxes in several states are well below the national average of $0.4869 a gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. In some low gas price states, these taxes are below $0.40. This includes South Carolina at $0.3515, Missouri at $0.3570 and Oklahoma at $0.3540. Low gas taxes in these states compound the effect of falling oil prices.The odds grow each day that gas prices will be $1 a gallon in some areas in the United States, particularly those where prices are already close to hitting $1.40 — and falling.24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

"Protesters in Arizona briefly blocked access to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s rally Saturday morning in Arizona, kicking off a full day of campaign events in the border state, which holds key primaries Tuesday.The protesters blocked a highway leading to Trump’s outdoor rally in Fountain Hills, Arizona, near Scottsdale, before sheriff's deputies removed them and towed their vehicles.“We’re not going to let demonstrators intimidate this forum and this sheriff. Now we’re going to have a nice, nice rally for Donald Trump,” said Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who led the effort to remove the demonstrators and who has endorsed the GOP front-runner.Arizona has long been ground-zero for the politically-charged illegal immigration debate, with roughly 368 miles of border with Mexico and more border fence than any other state.Roughly 30 percent of Arizona’s population is Hispanic. And in 2010, the state passed one of the strictest anti-immigration laws in American history.“So much crime and drugs passing through the border. You know what? We’re going to build a wall, and we’re going to stop it,” Trump said at the rally, returning to his early and oft-repeated campaign promise to build a wall along the southern border and have Mexico pay for it.Arpaio – the self-described “America’s toughest sheriff” – said at least 10,000 people were kept waiting in the Arizona heat for about an hour as a result of the roadblock, which resulted in three arrests.Trump supporters and protesters exchanged words at the rally, but there were no initial reports of physical violence.Trump, who early in his campaign visited the border, leads the GOP field in Arizona with 34 percent of the vote, followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 21 percent and Ohio Gov. John Kasich at 13 percent.Trump held a larger rally later Saturday at the Phoenix Convention Center.Trump said protesters at his rally are ""taking away our First Amendment rights"" and vowed to take the country back if he's elected president.He called one protester at his Phoenix rally, who wore the Klu Klux Klan hood, ""disgusting."" Another group, carrying a ""Black Lives Matter"" sign were also kicked out.The rallies and protest follow a local border patrol union of Friday supporting Trump.Local 2544 said Trump asked for the endorsement and that officials responded by saying he is the only 2016 White House candidate to “publicly expressed his support” of the Border Patrol’s mission and it agents and that he has been “an outspoken candidate” on the need for a secure border.However, Art Del Cueto, president of the Tucson-based union, made clear that he would adhere to the larger National Border Patrol Council’s practice of not endorsing presidential candidates.The Supreme Court later upheld the most controversial part of Arizona’s 2010 law -- commonly referred to S.B. 1070 and that allows police to try to determine the immigration status of anybody arrested or detained if they have “reasonable suspicion” the suspect is in the U.S. illegally.However, the law also sparked widespread opposition including businesses threatening to leave the state.Trump and Cruz essentially call for those living illegally in the United States to return to their home country, while Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders want to allow them to stay.Several thousand miles away in New York, demonstrators also took to the streets to protest the Republican presidential hopeful.The protesters gathered Saturday in Manhattan's Columbus Circle, across from Central Park, with a heavy police presence.

"Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi has resigned under pressure from Shiite rebels who seized the capital in September and have confined the embattled leader to his home for the past two days.Presidential officials said Hadi resigned after being pressured to make concessions to the rebels, known as Houthis. He had earlier pledged political concessions in return for the rebels withdrawing from his house and the nearby presidential palace, but Houthi fighters remained deployed around both buildings throughout the day.Military officials close to the president, who like the other officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters, said Hadi resigned after the Houthis pressured him to give a televised speech to calm the streets.State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Thursday that the U.S. is assessing and seeking confirmation of the report.""We are seeking a peaceful transition,"" she said.The Yemeni government also submitted its resignation Thursday.Prime Minister Khaled Bahah's resignation came as the U.N. envoy to the Arab world's poorest country met with representatives from the rebels, known as Houthis and other political factions to try to implement a deal reached Wednesday to end the crisis.Under the agreement, the group's militias were to withdraw from the presidential palace and key areas of the capital they have overrun in recent days in return for political concessions.It remains unclear who really controls the country.Twenty-four hours after signing the deal, heavily armed Shiite rebels remained stationed outside Hadi's house and the presidential palace.Bahah's technocratic government was formed in November as part of a United Nations-brokered peace deal after the Houthis overran the capital in September.Bahah, a political independent, posted his resignation on his official Facebook page, saying he had held office in ""very complicated circumstances."" He says he resigned in order to ""avoid being dragged into an abyss of unconstructive policies based on no law.""""We don't want to be a party to what is happening or will happen,"" he added.In an attempt to end the logjam, U.N. Envoy Jamal Benomar arrived to the country and held a meeting with Houthis and other political factions to push for implementation of the deal.In a brief press conference before the meeting, Benomar told reporters that the deal -- in essence an activation of the previous UN-brokered agreement struck in September when Houthis overran the capital -- is ""the only solution for Yemen.""Yemen's emerging power vacuum has raised fears that the country's dangerous Al Qaeda branch, which claimed the recent attack on a French satirical weekly, will only grow more powerful and popular as the nation slides toward fragmentation and the conflict takes on an increasingly sectarian tone. The Shiite Houthis and the Sunni terror group are sworn enemies.While the capital was free of violence, clashes did erupt southeast of Sanaa between Houthi gunmen and local tribesman. Tribal leaders said two tribesmen and four gunmen allied with Houthi rebels were killed in Khawlan-Watadah, 30 miles from Sanaa.The violence appeared to subside by midday, but a serious flare-up in the region lying along the road to Marib province, an oil-rich area in central Yemen and a haven for Al Qaeda fighters, could torpedo peace efforts. At the entrance of Marib itself, clashes also erupted between Houthis and local tribesmen over new checkpoints erected by tribal fighters.The Associated Press contributed to this report.","Reframe the text as a pilot's log, navigating through the events or ideas as if on a journey.","**Pilot's Log - Yemeni Crisis****Date:** Thursday, October 26, 2023**Location:** Sanaa, Yemen**Current Position:** Navigating through the ongoing crisis in Yemen, with a focus on the events of the day.**Summary:**Today, Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi resigned under pressure from Shiite rebels who seized the capital in September.

"There were several reports this month, based on former and current aides, that Mitt Romney is actively weighing another presidential run. The biggest sign yet comes from a recent interview with The New York Times, where the former 2012 Republican nominee offered a less than Shermanesque response to the million-dollar question.This was the obvious opening for me to ask if there was a chance. Romney's response was decidedly meta — ""I have nothing to add to the story"" -- but he then fell into the practiced political parlance of nondenial. ""We've got a lot of people looking at the race,"" he said. ""We'll see what happens.""Buoyed by good poll numbers and a wide-open prospective Republican field, Romney went farther than his ""circumstances can change"" reply in August, and certainly miles forward from the, ""Oh, no, no, no.

"U.S. counterterrorism officials are reviewing databases of known terror suspects and other materials after the deadly Paris shooting Wednesday morning, as the Obama administration opened the door to increasing security in the U.S. in response.The terror attack on a satirical French publication known for lampooning Islam left at least 12 dead, and the attackers remain at large. U.S. officials already are in touch with their French counterparts.The attackers reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar,"" Arabic for ""God is great, before escaping.Two French officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, named the suspects to the Associated Press as Frenchmen Said Kouachi and Cherif Kouachi, in their early 30s, as well as 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad, whose nationality wasn't immediately clear.One of the officials said they were linked to a Yemeni terrorist network.All three remain at large.Cherif Kouachi was convicted in 2008 of terrorism charges for helping funnel fighters to Iraq's insurgency and sentenced to 18 months in prison.Fox News is told investigators had been reviewing terror databases, including for individuals who have traveled to Syria. They also looked to closed-circuit television and evidence from the crime scene.In addition to identifying the suspects, the focus will be on determining whether this is isolated or part of a series of attacks.It is thought to be an attack carried out by a small cell, which distinguishes this from recent lone-wolf attacks, including one in Ottawa, Canada, and another more recent attack in Sydney, Australia. Officials are looking at the level of premeditation, given eyewitness accounts that the gunmen asked for individuals by name as they stormed the office.In addition, Fox News is told the assailants showed skill and familiarity with their weapons, and their escape also showed premeditation.A Department of Homeland Security official told Fox News that the department is ""closely monitoring"" the situation.""DHS will not hesitate to adjust our security posture, as appropriate, to protect the American people,"" the official said, urging the public to report suspicious activity to law enforcement.However, the office of the U.S. Embassy in France tweeted that there are ""no plans"" to close the embassy in Paris or other diplomatic facilities in France despite ""misleading"" press reports.U.S. investigators are expected to get more formally involved, but only after a request from the French government.Based on conversations with government officials and analysts, they are looking at three categories of suspects: self-radicalized individuals; members of Al Qaeda and its affiliates, specifically Al Qaeda's offshoot in North Africa known as AQIM; and those who have traveled to Syria and gotten training from Al Qaeda or the Islamic State.The latest edition of Inspire magazine, from the Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen, calls for attacks on France, as well as America and other allies.Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., told Fox News he has confidence in French authorities who are pursuing suspects as well. ""I would think that one way or the other, they will find them,"" he said.King also said the attack should be a ""wake-up call"" for Congress not to cut funding for DHS, despite an ongoing fight over funding the administration's immigration initiatives.Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C.

"Why Negotiators At Paris Climate Talks Are Tossing The Kyoto ModelNegotiators and heads of state from nearly 200 countries are meeting for the next two weeks near Paris to craft a new treaty to slow global warming.It's the 21st ""Conference of the Parties"" held by the United Nations to tackle climate change. One treaty emerged, in 1997, after the conference in Kyoto, Japan. That's no longer in effect, and, in fact, the Kyoto Protocol, as it's known, didn't slow down the gradual warming of the planet.Now governments are ever more desperate to do something to slow warming — so much so that they've thrown out the model set in Kyoto and opted for a new approach for Paris.Valli Moosa, a former climate negotiator from South Africa, says the main reason Kyoto failed to slow warming lies largely with who wasn't included in the treaty. ""You actually cannot have a meaningful agreement without China and the United States being part of it,"" he says.The U.S. Senate refused to ratify the Kyoto treaty, so the world's biggest greenhouse-gas emitter didn't have skin in the game. And developing countries, including China and India, were not required to reduce emissions. Now those countries are becoming the biggest sources of greenhouse gases as their economies thrive. China, in fact, is now the world's biggest emitter, and India isn't far behind. Moreover, the Kyoto treaty had U.N. bureaucrats and negotiators setting goals for the participating countries to lower their greenhouse gases. Many countries didn't make their targets; others dropped out. Economies were at stake, and few countries were comfortable marching to a U.N. beat.So what negotiators are bringing to the table at the Paris talks is an arrangement whereby each country is offering to reduce its own emissions by whatever amount it can manage. And everybody participates, not just developed countries.Most nations arrive with a reduction target already in hand. What will be difficult is deciding who will pay how much to developing countries to build economies that won't keep producing high emissions.French negotiator Laurence Tubiana points out that the key to success is convincing governments that those economies can be ""low-carbon,"" and that this won't be a bar to developing wealth. ""How much I'm sacrificing for the sake of emissions reductions, that's no more,"" she says of the message that negotiators are pushing. ""And now ... the Chinese, even the Indians are really coming in. It's about low-carbon economy.""Previous attempts to replace the Kyoto treaty have failed. This new approach is voluntary, and most of the world has agreed theoretically to participate, which negotiators hope will sweeten things enough to get a deal. Still to be determined, however, is who will pay for this massive revolution in the world's energy economy, and what strings will be attached to their largesse.","Transform the article into a treasure map, leading to insights or conclusions hidden within the story.","**The map:****Start:** The conference room in Paris, where negotiators are meeting.**Follow:** The path of the Kyoto Protocol, which failed to slow global warming due to the exclusion of major players like China and the U.S.**Dig:** The reasons for the Kyoto Protocol's failure, including the lack of participation from major emitters and the setting of unrealistic"

"BREAKING: Black-clad gunmen stormed the Paris offices of a satirical newspaper known for lampooning Islamic radicals early Wednesday, killing 12 and injuring as many as 15 before escaping, French officials said.As many as three Kalashnikov-toting shooters were being sought after the attack at Charlie Hebdo, the newspaper known for challenging Muslim terrorists with a 2011 caricature of Prophet Mohammed on its cover and which recently tweeted a cartoon of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Two policemen and several journalists - including the cartoonist behind the newspaper's provocative images, were among the dead.“We’ve avenged the honor of the prophet!” the killers shouted, according to witnesses who spoke to Sky News. The gunmen spoke French without any accent, according to Le MondeThe gunmen fled in a stolen car, and may have quickly ditched it and disappeared into the French capital's subway system, according to reports. A pedestrian has been injured by the terrorist’s vehicle, and there has been a second shootout, according to Le Figaro.French President Francois Hollande branded the attack an act of terrorism and claimed that several other potential terror attacks had been thwarted ""in recent weeks."" Hollande added that the newspaper had been threatened in the past and was already under police protection and surveillance.“This is a terrorist attack, there is no doubt about it,” Hollande told reporters.Elsewhere in France, newspaper offices, shopping centers, museums and stations were placed under police protection.Officials said the men walked into the ground floor of the newspaper's offices and began shooting before making their way up to the first floor. As they fled the scene, they shot at arriving policemen.“It was a real butchery,” Rocco Contento, a spokesman for the Unité police union, told The Guardian.Benoit Bringer, a journalist from the agency Premieres Lignes Tele, whose offices are next door, told the Telegraph he took refuge on the building's roof.""Three policemen arrived by push bike, but they left naturally as the attackers were armed,"" he said.The newspaper's offices are in the trendy 11th arrondissement of Paris, which includes posh restaurants and retail shops.Charlie Hebdo's offices were firebombed in 2011 after a spoof issue featuring a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad on its cover. Nearly a year later, the magazine published crude Muhammad caricatures, drawing denunciations around the Muslim world. One of the dead in Wednesday's attack was satirical cartoonist Stephane Charbonnier, the newspaper's editorial director and the artist behind the caricatures that offended jihadists. He was the subject of a fatwah, and there is a Facebook page called ""Execute Stephane Charbonnier.""British Prime Minister David Cameron condemned the attack and vowed solidarity with France.""The murders in Paris are sickening,"" Cameron said.

"Architect Of Paris Attacks Was Killed In Raid, French Authorities SayThe suspected architect of the Paris attacks was killed during a violent police raid conducted by French authorities in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis on Wednesday, French authorities say.Abdelhamid Abaaoud was a Belgian national in his late 20s. Authorities believe that Abaaoud was close to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi.During a press conference, Minister of the Interior Bernard Cazeneuve said that Abaaoud was believed to be responsible for planning many of the Islamic State attacks in Europe.Of the six planned attacks that have been foiled in France, he said, Abaaoud was believed to have been involved in four of them. Authorities believe he orchestrated the the three teams that attacked six locations across Paris and killed 129 people.Announcing his death, Cazeneuve said that as promised, ""the Republic is doing everything it can to destroy terrorism.""The Saint-Denis raid on Wednesday were bloody and violent. Police fired more than 5,000 rounds and one suspect — presumed to be a woman — detonated a suicide vest. Another suspect, whom we can now assume was Abaaoud, was killed by either gunfire or a grenade explosion during the confrontation with police.Yesterday, authorities said because of the carnage, forensic evidence had to be used to identify the dead. Today, Paris Prosecutor François Molins said that Abaaoud's was identified using fingerprints.As we've reported, until recently authorities believed that Abaaoud was issuing orders from Syria. Cazeneuve said that authorities knew that he had left for Syria in 2014, but they had no indication that he had come back to Europe.However, three days after the Paris attacks on Nov. 16, Cazeneuve said they received a tip from an ""intelligence service outside of Europe,"" saying they had picked up signals that Abaaoud had passed through Greece. Authorities across the world knew, he said, that an international warrant had been issued for Abaaoud's arrest. The implication there is that somehow Abaaoud's presence in Europe had fallen through the cracks.Cazeneuve added that he has called for a meeting with other European countries to talk about ways they can bolster cooperation on border controls and the fight against weapons trafficking.""Things are not going far enough. Things are not moving fast enough,"" Cazeneuve said. ""Europe owes it to all the victims of terrorism to act.""NPR's Dina Temple-Raston reports that the fate of Salah Abdeslam, whom police say was a key operative in the attacks, is still unknown. Another unidentified suspect may also still be on the loose.Meanwhile, in Belgium, police conducted raids at six locations across Brussels, including some in the Molenbeek suburb, which has become notorious for producing radicalized youth.NPR's Peter Kenyon reports that officials say they are looking for associates of Bilal Hadfi, one of the Islamist attackers who died during the Paris killings on Friday. Hadfi was one of two terrorists who detonated explosive vests just outside a packed stadium in north Paris.This is a breaking news story, we'll update this post with the latest as we get it, so make sure to refresh this page.Update at 8:11 a.m. ET.

"""From the start,"" Hillary Clinton declared today in Reno, ""Donald Trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia. He has taken hate groups mainstream, and [is] helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party."" The speech that followed those words was an extended argument that her opponent is a racist, a conspiracy theorist, and a man temperamentally unfit to be president.Clinton's campaign had promoted this in advance as an address about ""Donald Trump and his advisors' embrace of the disturbing 'alt-right' political philosophy""—the alt-right being an umbrella term for an assortment of racist micro-movements and online subcultures. Yesterday I suggested that making the alt-right the stars of such a speech could only give a signal boost to what is, after all, a rather obscure political faction. But Clinton's comments about that faction took up only about a minute of her remarks. And while that minute was pretty juicy, the alt-right wasn't really the rally's star villain after all.The star villain was Donald Trump. Everyone else that Clinton brought into the address—the alt-right, Breitbart, Alex Jones, David Duke, Nigel Farage, Vladimir Putin—was there in a supporting role.Some of Clinton's arguments didn't make a lot of sense. She led her litany, oddly, by quoting Trump's recent remarks about how bad blacks have it in America. (""Poverty. Rejection. Horrible education. No housing. No homes. No ownership. Crime at levels nobody has seen."") Most people would call his comments a clumsy attempt to reassure voters that he cares about the black community's problems, but Clinton declared them ""a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters."" She also wildly overstated the alt-right's influence, declaring that ""the de facto merger between Breitbart and the Trump campaign"" means the alt-rightists have ""effectively taken over the Republican Party."" She was on sturdier ground at other moments, as when she mentioned Trump's habit of retweeting white nationalists or his false claim that he watched thousands of New Jersey Muslims cheer the 9/11 attacks.Running through all her claims, both the weak ones and the strong ones, was one basic theme: Donald Trump is a bigot and a nut. And while that's an idea you've been hearing ever since the mogul turned reality TV star entered the race, this was as forceful and concentrated an expression of it as I've ever heard emerge from Hillary Clinton's mouth. It's bound to fire up her supporters, and I expect it will help her get out the vote. Whether it also leads a bunch of curious conservatives to Google ""alt-right"" depends, I suppose, on how much coverage that minute of the speech gets in the next few days.But the guy who must be really delighted right now is Alex Jones.

"Say what you will about Donald Trump, but the man is winner. Trump didn’t just wallop his opponents Tuesday — he crushed them. Up 41 percent in Delaware, 40 percent in Rhode Island, 37 percent in Pennsylvania, 33 percent in Maryland, 30 percent in Connecticut, he’s estimated to have won 110 delegates, versus five for Kasich and three for Cruz.If the race for the GOP nomination were a Little League game, the mercy rule would be imposed.Here’s where we stand today. Ted Cruz is mathematically eliminated from winning the Republican nomination before the convention in Cleveland. John Kasich has now won a single state — Ohio — where he is governor. If ever there were a series of states that would at least theoretically be fertile territory for him, it would be the Northeast, home of the last vestiges of Republican moderates. Yet, he didn’t crack 30 percent anywhere. Republicans can talk all they want about Never Trump and trying to stop him at the RNC in Cleveland. They can talk about changing the rules and holding out hope that a white knight candidate will emerge. It isn’t going to happen. Either Trump is the nominee or he’ll burn the whole thing to the ground. If you’re a gambler, go all in on the former.It is worth stepping back, however, and noting that Trump’s hammerlock over the party — and his ascendancy within the GOP — is astounding. He’s a political amateur who never held elected office; he’s a xenophobe, a bully, and a misogynist and he has run directly against the leadership of the party he hopes to lead. Yet, today he stands on the cusp of winning the nomination of the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Nixon, and Reagan. I know we’ve all become inured to Trump’s insults, his know-nothingness, and his crudeness, but it can’t be said enough — truly we are living in a political moment unlike anything that any of us has seen before.Here’s what might be even more amazing: Trump’s position as the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party is not the most remarkable political event this year. Rather, it’s that the Democratic Party is poised to nominate the first woman to be a major party candidate for president. Somehow this constantly seems to be forgotten; and whether you like Hillary Clinton or despise her, that America is poised to nominate a woman for president is a big deal.Tuesday night, Clinton racked up four more primary wins, including the delegate-rich states of Maryland and Pennsylvania. Only in Rhode Island did Bernie Sanders thwart her. Early on in the evening, before all the races had been called, he gave a “victory” speech in West Virginia that not only left unmentioned the evening’s results, but plowed forward with confidence about the road ahead. It’s a fitting metaphor for the Sanders campaign, which increasingly seems to operate in a realm completely divorced from reality. Sanders cannot and will not win the Democratic nomination. Period.Indeed, in her victory speech, Clinton — as she has increasingly done — simply ignored Sanders. Instead she aimed her daggers at her real target, Donald Trump. The Democratic race will continue, but for all intents and purposes, it is over. Clinton can now begin her pivot to the general election, and Sanders can play out the string.What we now with some certainty is that we’re only a few months away from an historic, unprecedented presidential campaign — and no matter which candidate wins on Election Day, history will be made.",Rewrite the article as a gripping short story with a moral at the end.,"The political landscape shifted dramatically on Tuesday night as Donald Trump delivered a crushing victory, securing a significant lead in the Republican race.

We have to actually make sure all LGBT couples can have full parenting rights, have full social security and other federal benefit rights. We want to make sure companies can’t discriminate against members of the community because of who they love and who they are. And it’s really important [to take on] discrimination wherever it exists.”Toward that end, Gillibrand last week reintroduced the Every Child Deserve a Family Act, which she originally introduced in 2013 and which would bar adoption and foster care agencies that receive federal dollars from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. Though Gillibrand says she's seeking bipartisan support in the Senate and will continue speaking with Republicans, so far co-sponsors include a handful of fellow Democrats, such as openly lesbian Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is running for the Democratic nomination for the presidency.“Only seven states ban discrimination based on sexual orientation in adoption, and only five explicitly ban discrimination in foster care,” Gillibrand said in the interview. “So we have a long way to go. We only have a few states protecting LGBT parents. The reality is, there are two million LGBT individuals and families that are willing and able to take on these parenting obligations, to adopt these children or foster these children who desperately need it. Unfortunately, there are 400,000 children in the U.S. foster care system today and more than 20,000 of them are going to age-out before finding a permanent home. So we should be caring for these kids. We should give them the loving families they deserve.”The bill, if it becomes law, would only affect those agencies that take federal money, and they are free to opt-out from receiving funds.""If you’re getting the benefit of federal funds, you can’t discriminate,” Gillibrand said. “It’s unconstitutional, and you should not be able to use our taxpayer dollars to discriminate against individuals based on their sexual orientation and who they love. So I think it’s important we fight against it, particularly when our taxpayer dollars are being used.”“This legislation would prohibit adoption agencies and foster care agencies, including religious adoption agencies and foster care agencies, from providing services in many cases,” Lori Windham, Senior Counsel with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty told the Catholic news agency, EWTN News. Peter Sprigg, senior fellow for policy studies at the Family Research Council, is quoted in the same article saying there are “unique problems” with allowing gays and lesbians to adopt children. Claiming there is “overwhelming” evidence while not citing any studies, Sprigg said, “I think it’s legitimate to disfavor them or to exclude them altogether.”",Format as a series of postcards from someone living through the article's events.,"Y.) recently stated.

"WASHINGTON -- The audience should have belonged to Sen. Rand Paul. After all, the thousand or so clean-cut millennials in the D.C.-area ballroom were members of Young Americans for Liberty, a student group founded by Paul’s father, former Rep. Ron Paul.The kids chuckled appreciatively as Rand unspooled his tart, college-dorm-room disdain for government. But he didn’t fire them up. Neither did Utah Sen. Mike Lee, the thoughtful-sounding son of a Reagan-era U.S. solicitor general.The man who got them cheering, who got them going, who got them roaring with derisive laughter and bubbling with anger at the depredations of liberals was: Sen. Ted Cruz.Striding the stage like Elvis (if Elvis had been a college debater at Princeton and a brilliant student at Harvard Law), Cruz was the firebrand whom the conserva-geeks wanted to either meet or become.That was more than a year ago, when the first-term senator from Texas was still in the hard-right afterglow of his bid to shut down the government in a vain (in both senses) attempt to stop Obamacare.But the Young Americans for Liberty loved his loathing of the party elders, and his determination to shove a stick between the spokes of the System.And it is that emotion -- across-the-board opposition to every “liberal” idea that exists, and disgust with the System in all of its manifestations -- that Cruz hopes to tap for the energy he thinks can somehow lift him to the presidency.Uncorked anger doesn’t usually win presidential nominations, let alone presidencies. People want hope and uplift in the White House and not just expressions of outrage. The president is the person who is supposed to make things work.To some, the 44-year-old Cruz gives off a vaguely scary aura of cheerful menace. For now, as Cruz officially announces his 2016 bid, he is nearly an asterisk in the early GOP polls, well behind somewhat less apocalyptic personalities, such as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.The first is that his angry approach may fit the times. Even as the voters depend more and more on government and politics -- perhaps for that very reason -- their regard for the machinery of both continues to plummet to new lows.Cruz beat the establishment in Texas like a drum. They hate him for it, but he is also going to raise a lot of cash in, yes, Texas.He is as pure an across-the-board conservative as it is possible to find in what has to be regarded as the big leagues of politics: culturally, fiscally, in monetary policy, in foreign policy.Cruz is triple 7s on the slot machine of issues: anti-abortion, a global-warming mega-skeptic, to the right of Likud on Israel, anti-immigration to the max, big on defense spending, etc.He is a libertarian, traditional conservative, war hawk and evangelical Baptist son of a preacher who fled Fidel Castro’s Cuba. There are plenty of philosophical and tactical contradictions in Cruz’s construct, but he ignores them all.","Transform the article into a fantasy tale, with elements of magic or myth intertwined with real events.","C., where the whispers of the past danced with the dreams of the future, a tale unfolded that intertwined the real with the fantastical.

"They came close in Iowa, but just fell short of claiming victory. Tuesday night in New Hampshire was a different story.The political outsiders have taken control of this election.Donald Trump won Tuesday night’s Republican primary in New Hampshire. By a margin of 34 percent to 16 percent for John Kasich, Trump proved that his slogan of “Make America Great Again” resonates with voters – in a big way.On the Democratic side, self proclaimed socialist Bernie Sanders edged Hillary Clinton out by 20 percentage points. His message railing against the rigged economy, special interests that control Washington and pledging to give Americans universal healthcare and free college tuition brought together a larger coalition of young voters than the one Barack Obama built in 2008.To my mind, Tuesday night’s results show that there are finally politicians who understand how marginalized, disenfranchised and betrayed a majority of Americans feel. It’s both Republicans and Democrats, including the 42 percent of Americans who now identify as independent because they think the two parties don’t represent their values and positions.We are seeing a full scale rejection of the political establishment. This is a threat that we did not take seriously enough over the past few years, as evidenced by the fact that most rejected Trump as a clown and a joke. His ideas on illegal immigration and placing a temporary ban on Muslims ruffled our national feathers even though a majority of Republican primary voters agreed with him. That’s how out of touch our political class has become.Indeed, 46 percent of GOP voters say they feel betrayed by Republican politicians. Trump won 32 percent of that group.We did the same thing to Bernie Sanders who began this race upwards of 50 points behind Hillary Clinton. We said a socialist could never win. And he may not be able to win a national election, but we are seeing an electorate so starved for an honest and trustworthy politician that they will make allowances for ideologies that they may not have considered before.Sanders has argued about oligarchy and money in politics and has been his whole career. He doesn’t flip flop or evolve on his advocacy for the average American.Sanders is just Bernie Sanders. And Donald Trump is just Donald Trump.We are living in a time when trust in Americans institutions has collapsed. A recent Pew survey shows that less than 20 percent of Americans trust the government always or most of the time. And a CNN poll showed that 60 percent think the American Dream is unachievable today.Against this backdrop, it’s no surprise that America is in revolt. Honesty and trustworthiness matters more than whether a candidate has experience or can win in November according to voters. And the establishment isn’t delivering anything resembling what the American populace desires in their political leaders.I see a clearer path to the nomination for Trump than for Sanders, but there is no doubt that Americans have spoken and they’re done with business as usual.Douglas E.

"The Republican Party’s identity crisis keeps getting worse. Hours after House Speaker Paul Ryan said he was not ready to support Donald Trump, the presumptive G.O.P. nominee, 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney also refused to endorse his successor, saying that he was “dismayed” by the state of American politics and that he wished for “better choices” for candidates who, unfortunately, do not exist anymore.While Romney ruled out the possibility of a third-party candidacy during a Q&A at a fundraising gala Thursday night in Washington, he said he was so fundamentally disappointed with the G.O.P. that he could not support Trump in good conscience, nor would he switch allegiances and support Hillary Clinton.“I see way too much demagoguery and populism on both sides of the aisle and I only hope and aspire that we'll see more greatness,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.Earlier this year, Romney championed the Never Trump movement, attempting to block his nomination by proposing the remaining Republican candidates unite to force a contested convention in which an alternative would win the nomination despite winning fewer primaries. That dream ended earlier this week when Ted Cruz dropped out of the race (and John Kasich soon after), but that didn’t stop Romney from sticking to his convictions.“I happen to think that the person who is leading the nation has an enormous and disproportionate impact on the course of the world, so I am dismayed at where we are now,” he said. “I wish we had better choices, and I keep hoping that somehow things will get better, and I just don't see an easy answer from where we are.”Romney also praised Ryan, his former running mate, who recently took on Trump. “He is where he needs to be,” he explained, saying that he was impressed that Ryan could somehow get the wildly fractious House G.O.P. to work together. “I’d love to see him run for president, but having a Speaker of the House, at this stage, where we don’t know what’s going to happen on the presidential race, having a Speaker of the House with that kind of leadership capacity is very encouraging. I have hopes that he’ll remain Speaker.”Romney may not be the first Republican leader to publicly disavow Trump since he became the party’s nominee—that honor goes to Nebraska senator Ben Sasse, who quickly argued that an “adult” step in and run for president on a third-party ticket—but he is by far the most prominent. So far, there have been rumblings within an embarrassed G.O.P. that they could never support Trump: both George H.W. Bush and his son George W. Bush refused to endorse or comment on the nomination, and do not plan on attending the Republican National Convention. Senator John McCain was recorded saying that Trump would severely hurt his re-election chances in Arizona, a Latino-heavy state that borders Mexico. And, as Hillary Clinton highlighted in an e-mail blast, that sentiment isn’t limited to high-profile Republicans, either: dozens of other G.O.P. congressional representatives, governors, and major political figures are all quickly boarding the anti-Trump train—or, at the very least, refusing to comment.",Describe the events as if they were part of a historical epic tale.,"The Republican Party's identity crisis unfolded like a tale of ancient times, a tale steeped in political intrigue and disillusionment.

"The poll, conducted from Monday to Friday, showed Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, with a 10.7 point lead among likely voters over Trump, her likely Republican rival in the November presidential election. That's down from a lead of 14.3 points for Clinton on Sunday, the day an American-born shooter who declared allegiance to militant group Islamic State killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.Trump seized on the attack to sharpen his security proposals, saying he would block immigration to the United States from any country with a ""proven history of terrorism"" against America and its allies if elected. The pledge fine-tuned an earlier vow, made after the attacks last year in Paris and California, to ban the entry of all Muslims into the United States.He also called for measures to make it more difficult for suspected terrorists to obtain firearms, veering from the Republican Party's general opposition to gun control.While Trump's comments on both Muslims and guns dismayed some Republican elites, they may have cheered some voters.Some 45 percent of Americans said they supported Trump's idea to suspend Muslim immigration, up from 41.9 percent at the start of the month, according to the poll. Meanwhile, about 70 percent of Americans, including a majority of Democrats and Republicans, said they wanted to see at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns, up from 60 percent in similar polls in 2013 and 2014.Clinton focused her response to the Orlando attack on the need to boost intelligence gathering and defeat Islamic State and what she called ""radical jihadist terrorism,"" while warning against demonizing Muslim-Americans. She also repeated her calls for tougher gun control measures, including a ban on assault weapons.As usual after a major attack, ""terrorism"" jumped to the top concern among all adults in the poll - rising above the economy, health care and other major issues.The poll's five-day average showed that 45.5 percent of likely American voters supported Clinton, while 34.8 percent supported Trump, and another 19.7 percent did not support either candidate. On Sunday, Clinton's support was at 46.6 percent, versus Trump's 32.3 percent.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English with adults living in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii. The political horserace poll included 1,133 likely voters and has a credibility interval, a measure of the poll's accuracy, of 3.4 percentage points.","Rewrite the article from an alternative perspective, such as from the viewpoint of a person mentioned in the story or from a neutral observer's perspective.","The recent poll conducted by Reuters/Ipsos showcased the shifting political landscape in the wake of the tragic shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.

"The Islamic State (IS) group claimed to have carried out a deadly suicide attack in eastern Afghanistan Saturday that killed at least 33 people and injured more than 100, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said, in what, if verified, would be the first major attack claimed by the jihadist group in the country.""Who claimed responsibility for horrific attack in Nangarhar today? The Taliban did not claim responsibility for the attack, Daesh (IS) claimed responsibility for the attack,"" President Ghani said on a visit to northeastern Badakhshan province.A person purporting to be an IS spokesman said in a call to AFP that the group claimed responsibility for the bombing outside a bank in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad.An online posting allegedly from the group made the same claim, which could not be immediately verified.""Thirty-three dead bodies and more than 100 wounded were brought to the hospital,"" Dr Najeebullah Kamawal, head of the provincial hospital, told AFP.Ahmad Zia Abdulzai, a provincial government spokesman, confirmed the attack -- the deadliest since November.""The explosion happened outside the bank when government employees and civilians were collecting their monthly salaries,"" he told AFP.The UN gave a higher toll, saying 35 people had been killed.President Ghani strongly condemned the attack, which saw children among those killed, his office said in a statement.""Carrying out terrorist attacks in cities and public places are the most cowardly acts of terror by terrorists targeting innocent civilians,"" President Ghani said.The scene of the attack showed the gruesome scale of the carnage with people lying in pools of blood and body parts scattered across the ground.The bombing comes as Afghanistan braces for what is expected to be a bloody push by the Taliban at the start of the fighting season.The militants have stepped up attacks on government and foreign targets since Washington backpedalled on plans to shrink the US force in Afghanistan this year by nearly half.The Taliban have seen defections to IS in recent months, with some insurgents voicing their disaffection with their one-eyed supreme leader Mullah Omar, who has not been seen since the 2001 US-led invasion of Afghanistan.The Afghan government has also raised the ominous prospect of IS making inroads into the country, though the group that has captured swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq has never formally acknowledged having a presence in Afghanistan.","Rewrite the text as a children's story, making it engaging and educational for young readers.","In a land far, far away, in the beautiful country of Afghanistan, there lived a group of people called the Daesh (IS).

"LAS VEGAS  The Democratic presidential candidates are holding their first debate Tuesday night in Las Vegas.It marks the first time frontrunner Hillary Clinton and her main challenger so far  socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.  will appear on the same stage in this campaign, along with the other three candidates.This campaign was expected to be a cakewalk for the former first lady, but it hasn't turned out that way.One big reason seems to be the story that just won't away: how she used a private email server to conduct government business. It's fed a perception that she can play by a different set of rules.Even so, Clinton still has a decent lead nationally over the socialist senator from Vermont, but Sanders is coming on strong. He's beating her comfortably in the key state of New Hampshire and is close in Iowa, too.Plus, Sanders is the one drawing tens of thousands of people to his events. Democratic voters seem to be listening intently to his populist messages.With the threat from Sanders a reality, Clinton is now trying to reposition herself a little more leftward. Just recently she came out against President Barack Obama's big Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement.That's a reversal because while serving as secretary of state, she was for it. This new position puts her more in line with the liberal base of her party.""As of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it,"" Clinton said. ""I don't believe it's going to meet the high bar I have set.""So, tonight the drama will center on how much Sen. Sanders and the other Democrats confront Clinton directly on the debate stage.Expect former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley to be an instigator. He's trying to get traction and has taken some shots at Clinton over the last few months.As for Clinton herself, she's trying to avoid a repeat of 2008 when she went in as the heavy favorite, then ran into a buzz saw called Barack Obama.This time around the buzz is growing for Bernie Sanders.","Convert the article into a mystery or detective story, building suspense around the events described.","The Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas was shrouded in mystery, a stage set for a clash of political intrigue and a battle for the hearts of the voters.

"Donald Trump appeared to use his foundation to launch his presidential campaign ambitions, according to filings analyzed by RealClearPolitics.From 2011 to 2014, Trump sent at least $286,000 to conservative or policy groups. The contributions corresponded to speaking engagements and endorsements as Trump cast himself as a potential presidential candidate, according to the analysis. If the contributions were solely to benefit Trump, they could be in violation of IRS laws that prohibit private foundations from self-dealing.One source with Trump ties told RealClearPolitics, ""He was politically active starting in 2011,"" and started to make ""strategic donations"" then. Most of the donations came from Trump personally to campaigns and political parties. Donations sent to nonprofit arms of conservative policy groups were sent through Trump's foundation. ""If he could do 501(c)(3) to 501(c)(3), he did it that way,"" the source said, referring to the tax code designation for nonprofit organizations.RealClearPolitics' analysis found that in 2013, Trump's foundation donated to The Family Leader, 501(c) 4 established to ""develop, advocate, and support legislative agenda at the state level.""

"WASHINGTON –- Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign on Wednesday announced a massive fundraising haul in the quarter that ended on June 30, further cementing her status as the clear front-runner in the 2016 race.All told, the Democratic candidate and former secretary of state raised more than $45 million in primary campaign contributions between her campaign announcement in April and the end of June. That figure, according to a Clinton aide, is the most that any candidate has ever raised in their opening quarter, topping President Barack Obama's roughly $42 million in the first quarter of 2011.Clinton's haul would also shatter the previous record for an opening fundraising total by a non-incumbent presidential candidate, which she herself set in the first quarter of 2007. To set that record, she raised $26 million in the first three months of her first presidential campaign while transferring an additional $10 million from her Senate campaign account. At the time, Obama trailed closely behind with $25 million.The Clinton campaign will also report that 91 percent of the donations it received were $100 or less in value. However, the Clinton aide did not have a total for how many individual donors gave to the campaign.","Write as an open-source project description, calling for contributions related to the article's topic.","The Democratic candidate and former secretary of state raised more than $45 million in primary campaign contributions between her campaign announcement in April and the end of June.

"Dragging on for an excruciating eternity, this election season has demeaned democracy, elevated mediocrity and insulted and embarrassed us all on just about every level imaginable: Intellectually, with regard to the lack of focus on policy and substance; ethically, with a complete disregard for integrity and character; and morally, driven by a disgraceful descent into racist and xenophobic vitriol.Given that our country has consistently climbed down the educational attainment ladder, and that inane and banal reality TV shows draw more eyeballs than books and opera , it should not surprise us that a growing swath of the electorate is more enthused by a coarse, bullying celebrity than by an awkward policy wonk.But what's doubly disappointing -- as we head into the crucial presidential debates -- is that this lack of intellectual depth is enabled not only by the candidates, but also by the topics they gravitate to, which the media frenzy then exacerbates.These are topics that don't matter when it comes to making a difference in the future of our country: the size of a candidate's hands (and therefore other body parts), the now-moot birther issue, the Monica Lewinsky and Marla Maples scandals, the name-calling and finger pointing about who is more racist than whom, who is healthier than whom.","Draft as a futuristic news report, projecting the outcomes of ongoing trends.","The ongoing election season has been a spectacle of low blows and even lower intellect.

"Washington (CNN) Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is standing his ground in his belief that allowing transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice ""opens the door for predators,"" dismissing criticism from Caitlyn Jenner, who mocked him over the issue last week.""This is not a matter of right or left, or Democrat or Republican. This is common sense. It doesn't make sense for grown adult men, strangers, to be alone in a restroom with a little girl,"" Cruz told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union.""""This is the height of political correctness,"" Cruz continued. ""And frankly, the concern is not of the Caitlyn Jenners of the world, but if the law is such that any man, if he feels like it, can go in a woman's restroom and you can't ask him to leave, that opens the door for predators.""Jenner, a reality TV star and activist for transgender causes, posted a video to Facebook on Wednesday knocking Cruz for his support of a controversial North Carolina law that requires people to use the bathroom that corresponds with their ""biological sex"" stated on their birth certificate, rather than how they self-identify.After using a women's bathroom in the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City -- following a recent comment by Trump in which he said Jenner could use whichever bathroom she wanted at the tower -- Jenner, a Republican, quipped: ""By the way, Ted, nobody got molested.""""I've spent a lot of years in law enforcement dealing with child predators that are sick individuals,"" Cruz told Tapper. ""That doesn't mean that that is the people who are transgendered.

"WASHINGTON -- While the Obama administration's decision to designate ISIS's atrocities against Christians and other minorities as ""genocide"" is important, many warn that it's only the beginning of the process.""In my judgment Daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in territory under its control,"" Kerry said, using the Arabic acronym for the jihadist army.It's a critical first step towards protecting Christians from ISIS and other Islamic radicals in Iraq and Syria.""Every jihadist in the Middle East believes they can kill, kidnap, enslave and otherwise torture Christians and other religious minorities and they believe they can do it without repercussions,"" said Johnnie Moore, author of the book Defying ISIS.In northern Iraq, Assyrian Christians are an ancient people descended from the first followers of Christ.""As Assyrians of the Middle East we are on the verge of extinction,"" warned Juliana Taimoorazy, founder and president of the Iraqi Christian Relief Council, an organization that raises awareness about the persecuted Church in Iraq.Taimoorazy recently visited Telskuf in the Nineveh Plains of Iraq, where 200,000 Christians have fled from ISIS.""The homes are destroyed when you walk inside,"" she said. ""Their closets are all broken, the beds are all overturned - the kitchens are destroyed.""Secretary Kerry's genocide designation helps keep the plight of these Christians near the front of U.S. foreign policy.Advocates wasted no time celebrating. They're already working with the State Department to ensure Christians are represented in Syrian peace talks and that property rights for those forced to flee their homes in Iraq are enforced.""There are going to be borders redrawn, constitutions redrafted,"" Nina Shea, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, told CBN News.""It's absolutely essential that the Christians have a voice in this process or they will have no place in the new Syria or in the new Iraq,"" she warned.There's already an effort to create a safe haven in the Nineveh Plains so that Christians, Yazidis and other minorities can return home, govern themselves and rebuild their lives without fear of extermination.""If you care about the presence of Christianity, the Christian witness, in this very Gospel poor part of the world you will support the idea of a safe haven,"" Robert Nicholson, executive director of the Philos Project, told CBN News.In spite of the horrors they've experienced at the hands of ISIS, Christians in this part of the world are experiencing a revival of their faith.""They have told me repeatedly it's because of persecution that has been inflicted on them that they have grown closer to Christ that they find themselves praying more that they're thirsty for the Gospel more,"" Taimoorazy said.Now the same advocates who pushed for the genocide designation are moving to keep up the pressure, hoping to ensure the Obama administration not only talks, but acts to protect those persecuted Christians and other religious minorities.They hope to make real progress before the next administration moves into the White House.","Write a satirical piece, exaggerating the article's themes for comic effect.","""In my judgment Daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in territory under its control,"" Secretary Kerry said, using the Arabic acronym for the jihadist army.

"WASHINGTON -- The audience should have belonged to Sen. Rand Paul. After all, the thousand or so clean-cut millennials in the D.C.-area ballroom were members of Young Americans for Liberty, a student group founded by Paul’s father, former Rep. Ron Paul.The kids chuckled appreciatively as Rand unspooled his tart, college-dorm-room disdain for government. But he didn’t fire them up. Neither did Utah Sen. Mike Lee, the thoughtful-sounding son of a Reagan-era U.S. solicitor general.The man who got them cheering, who got them going, who got them roaring with derisive laughter and bubbling with anger at the depredations of liberals was: Sen. Ted Cruz.Striding the stage like Elvis (if Elvis had been a college debater at Princeton and a brilliant student at Harvard Law), Cruz was the firebrand whom the conserva-geeks wanted to either meet or become.That was more than a year ago, when the first-term senator from Texas was still in the hard-right afterglow of his bid to shut down the government in a vain (in both senses) attempt to stop Obamacare.But the Young Americans for Liberty loved his loathing of the party elders, and his determination to shove a stick between the spokes of the System.And it is that emotion -- across-the-board opposition to every “liberal” idea that exists, and disgust with the System in all of its manifestations -- that Cruz hopes to tap for the energy he thinks can somehow lift him to the presidency.Uncorked anger doesn’t usually win presidential nominations, let alone presidencies. People want hope and uplift in the White House and not just expressions of outrage. The president is the person who is supposed to make things work.To some, the 44-year-old Cruz gives off a vaguely scary aura of cheerful menace. For now, as Cruz officially announces his 2016 bid, he is nearly an asterisk in the early GOP polls, well behind somewhat less apocalyptic personalities, such as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.The first is that his angry approach may fit the times. Even as the voters depend more and more on government and politics -- perhaps for that very reason -- their regard for the machinery of both continues to plummet to new lows.Cruz beat the establishment in Texas like a drum. They hate him for it, but he is also going to raise a lot of cash in, yes, Texas.He is as pure an across-the-board conservative as it is possible to find in what has to be regarded as the big leagues of politics: culturally, fiscally, in monetary policy, in foreign policy.Cruz is triple 7s on the slot machine of issues: anti-abortion, a global-warming mega-skeptic, to the right of Likud on Israel, anti-immigration to the max, big on defense spending, etc.He is a libertarian, traditional conservative, war hawk and evangelical Baptist son of a preacher who fled Fidel Castro’s Cuba. There are plenty of philosophical and tactical contradictions in Cruz’s construct, but he ignores them all.","Compose as a farewell speech from a key figure mentioned, reflecting on their journey.",**Strengths:*** **Strong opening:** The first few sentences are strong and set the tone for the speech.* **Clear structure:** The speech has a clear structure and follows a logical flow.* **Engaging tone:** The speech has an engaging tone that is both humorous and serious.* **Clear conclusion:** The speech has a clear conclusion that summarizes the
"Donald Trump appeared to use his foundation to launch his presidential campaign ambitions, according to filings analyzed by RealClearPolitics.From 2011 to 2014, Trump sent at least $286,000 to conservative or policy groups. The contributions corresponded to speaking engagements and endorsements as Trump cast himself as a potential presidential candidate, according to the analysis. If the contributions were solely to benefit Trump, they could be in violation of IRS laws that prohibit private foundations from self-dealing.One source with Trump ties told RealClearPolitics, ""He was politically active starting in 2011,"" and started to make ""strategic donations"" then. Most of the donations came from Trump personally to campaigns and political parties. Donations sent to nonprofit arms of conservative policy groups were sent through Trump's foundation. ""If he could do 501(c)(3) to 501(c)(3), he did it that way,"" the source said, referring to the tax code designation for nonprofit organizations.RealClearPolitics' analysis found that in 2013, Trump's foundation donated to The Family Leader, 501(c) 4 established to ""develop, advocate, and support legislative agenda at the state level."" Organizations with 501(c ) 4 designation can engage in limited political activity. Trump's filing was not properly noted, if it was sent as a donation to the group's nonprofit or to the organization.""Improper reporting is still a violation of tax law,"" charity law specialist Rosemary Fei told RealClearPolitics.The report pointed to other examples that appear to show Trump using his foundation to curry political favor, such as Trump's foundation donating $100,000 to the Citizens United Foundation ahead of a ""cattle call"" of possible Republican presidential candidates sponsored by the group, which Trump attended.In 2013, Trump's foundation donated $50,000 to the American Conservative Union Foundation. One source said, ""Everyone's too smart to say, 'Donate and we'll let you speak.' It was kind of understood.""Trump spoke at the Economic Club in Washington, D.C. Dec. 15, 2015, and his foundation sent a check to that group for $6,000 that appeared on its 2014 filing.""If what he talked about was promoting his candidacy or fundraising for his campaign, it is not only self-dealing, but potentially involves the foundation in making a grant to support political activity. That's prohibited,"" Fei said.Voters appear concerned about the Trump Foundation, according to a Morning Consult poll.By comparison, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's Clinton Foundation has more support.Voters in the poll believe the Trump Foundation's purpose is:The poll was taken before New York's attorney general ordered the Trump Foundation to stop soliciting in the state.","Convert the article into a narrative, telling the story through the experiences of individuals directly affected by the events.","Through the experiences of individuals directly affected by the events, the story unfolds.In 2011, Trump's political activism commenced, and he began making ""strategic donations"" through his foundation.

"Federal laws already allow people across the country the option to register to vote at the DMV. But Oregon and California's laws are pioneering because they do it automatically.It's hard to overstate how novel this concept is for the US. Throughout much of United States history, governments frequently put up barriers aimed at preventing people from voting, such as property ownership requirements, poll taxes, or literacy tests.Gradually, many of these barriers have fallen to make it easier for people to register. However, many states, including California, still close off registration weeks to a month before an election — an artificial obstacle that can prevent perfectly qualified people from voting if they simply miss a deadline.These new proposals remove those obstacles. Oregon's law will register all adult citizens in the DMV's database, while California's law will be implemented more gradually, as people get or renew their licenses or state IDs, or change their addresses. But both make it the government's responsibility to ensure that all eligible voters are registered.So it's a big deal that governments are now trying to make it easier and easier to vote, rather than more difficult. Matt Yglesias has argued for going even further and enshrining an affirmative right to vote in our Constitution — read his case here.In both California and Oregon, Republicans opposed these proposals, but generally didn't argue against the principle of easing registration. Instead, the criticisms have fallen along two main lines.First, critics have argued that since voter registration data is more publicly accessible than DMV information, automatically adding voters to the rolls could pose privacy concerns. However, supporters respond that people can always opt out.Second, some Republicans have cited concerns about voter fraud — usually about potential registration of unauthorized immigrants. But while California began issuing driver's licenses to unauthorized immigrants this year, these licenses are distinctively marked, and people with them would not be registered to vote automatically. And Oregon requires proof of citizenship for all driver's license applicants.Meanwhile, national Democrats are increasingly adopting mandatory voter registration as a major cause. In a speech on voting rights this June, Hillary Clinton called on all states to automatically register citizens to vote when they turn 18, unless they choose to opt out. And legislators in 15 other states have introduced bills similar to Oregon's new law — the Brennan Center is tracking them here.","Reframe the article as a motivational speech, inspiring action or change based on the content.","""Ladies and Gentlemen, I stand before you today to share a momentous occasion in the history of our nation.

"Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton received a big convention bounce. A new CNN poll has her leading GOP rival Donald Trump 52 percent to 43 percent in a two-way matchup.The Republican nominee is still under fire for how he reacted over the weekend to the parents of Humayun Khan, a Muslim U.S. Army captain killed in Iraq.Khizr Khan blasted Trump at the Democratic convention, noting that unlike his fallen son, Trump has ""sacrificed nothing and no one."" Unwilling to the let the insult pass, Trump hit back, implying that Khan's wife wasn't allowed to speak during her husband's DNC address because of the family's Muslim faith.The GOP nominee's remarks have sparked outrage from veterans and members of his own party.""While our party has bestowed upon him the nomination, it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us,"" war hero Sen.

"The U.S. economy created the fewest number of jobs in more than five years in May, hurt by a strike by Verizon workers and a fall in goods producing employment, pointing to labor market weakness that could make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 38,000 jobs last month, the smallest gain since September 2010, the Labor Department said on Friday. Employers hired 59,000 fewer workers in March and April. The government said the month-long Verizon strike had depressed employment growth by 34,000 jobs.The goods producing sector, which includes mining and manufacturing, shed 36,000 jobs, the most since February 2010. Even without the Verizon strike, payrolls would have increased by a mere 72,000.The Verizon workers, who were considered unemployed because they did not receive a salary during the payrolls survey week, returned to their jobs on Wednesday. They are expected to boost June employment.The jobless rate fell three-tenths of a percentage point to 4.7 percent in May, the lowest since November 2007. The decrease in the unemployment rate was in part due to people dropping out of the labor force.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising 164,000 in May and the unemployment rate falling to 4.9 percent.Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said monthly gains of roughly 100,000 jobs are needed to keep up with growth in the work-age population. The U.S. central bank has signaled its intention to raise rates soon if job gains continued and economic data remained consistent with a pickup in growth in the second quarter.Yellen said last week that a rate increase would probably be appropriate in the ""coming months,"" if those conditions were met. Data on consumer spending, industrial production, goods exports and housing have suggested the economy is gathering speed after growth slowed to a 0.8 percent annualized rate in the first quarter.The Fed hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.There is still no sign of meaningful wage growth. Average hourly earnings rose five cents, or 0.2 percent, last month. That kept the year-on-year rise at 2.5 percent.Economists say wage growth of between 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent is needed to lift inflation to the Fed's 2.0 percent target. There are, however, signs that inflation is creeping higher as the dampening effects of the dollar's past rally and the oil price plunge dissipate.There was little change in other measures of labor market slack. A broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment held steady at 9.7 percent in May.The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell 0.2 percentage point to 62.6 percent.The gains in May were broadly weak, with the private sector adding only 25,000 jobs, the smallest since February 2010. Mining employment maintained its downward trend, shedding 10,000 positions. Mining payrolls have dropped by 207,000 since peaking in September 2014, with three-quarters of the losses in support activities.Manufacturing employment fell by 10,000 jobs. The Verizon labor dispute reduced information sector jobs by 34,000.Retail payrolls rose 11,400 after shedding jobs in April for the first time since December 2014. Temporary help jobs fell 21,000.","Reframe the text as a pilot's log, navigating through the events or ideas as if on a journey.","The U.S. labor market continued to struggle in May, creating the fewest number of jobs in more than five years.

"The Senate on Tuesday voted to block the controversial legislation cracking down on the so-called ""sanctuary cities"" that shield residents from federal immigration authorities.Following an impassioned speeches by Texas' Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and New Jersey's Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez arguing, respectively, for and against the Sanctuary Cities Bill, the Senate voted 54-46 against the legislation.The bill has divided Congress along partisan lines and gained national attention in the wake of GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump's harsh words on immigration and the shooting death of a California woman over the summer by an undocumented immigrant.""We are witnessing the most overtly nativist and xenophobic campaign in modern U.S. history,"" Menendez said on Tuesday. ""We've hit a new low with the extraordinarily hateful rhetoric that diminishes immigrants' contributions to American history — and particularly demonizes the Latino community by labeling Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals.""The bill, which went up for procedural vote on Tuesday, was authored by Louisiana Sen. David Vitter. It would have punished jurisdictions that prohibit the collection of immigration information or don't cooperate with federal requests, blocking them from receiving certain grants and funds.Republicans have pushed the bill since the July 1 shooting of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco. The man charged in the killing was in the country illegally despite a long criminal record and multiple prior deportations. The man, Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, had been released by San Francisco authorities despite a request from federal immigration authorities to keep him detained.""Today, the Senate had an opportunity to send the message that defiance of our laws will no longer be tolerated,"" Cruz said in a press release after the vote.

"WASHINGTON -- The Senate advanced legislation Monday night to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, even though President Barack Obama has already said he would veto it.The Senate voted 63-32 to clear a procedural hurdle and begin debate on the bill. Ten Democrats and one independent, Angus King (Maine), voted with every Republican to move the bill forward. Those Democrats included Sens. Michael Bennet (Colo.), Tom Carper (Del.), Bob Casey (Pa.), Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), Joe Manchin (W.Va.), Claire McCaskill (Mo.), Jon Tester (Mont.), Tom Udall (N.M.) and Mark Warner (Va.). A final vote is expected later this week.Despite the strong vote, the Senate lacks the two-thirds majority vote needed to overcome a veto. The House passed the bill last week by a vote of 266 to 153 -- also shy of the 290 votes needed to clear a veto.Congressional action on Keystone comes after the Nebraska Supreme Court cleared the way last week for the proposed pipeline's route through the state. The Obama administration had been waiting for the Nebraska ruling to render its own decision on the pipeline, which is still forthcoming.White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Friday that the State Department is examining the court's decision as part of its process to evaluate whether the Keystone XL Pipeline project serves the national interest.""As we have made clear, we are going to let that process play out,"" Schultz said. ""Regardless of the Nebraska ruling today, the House bill still conflicts with longstanding Executive branch procedures regarding the authority of the President and prevents the thorough consideration of complex issues that could bear on U.S. national interests, and if presented to the President, he will veto the bill.""This article has been updated to include additional details on which senators voted to move the bill forward.","Rewrite the text as a wedding vow, romantically linking the themes or messages of the story.","My beloved, I stand before you today with a heart filled with love and gratitude.

"Architect Of Paris Attacks Was Killed In Raid, French Authorities SayThe suspected architect of the Paris attacks was killed during a violent police raid conducted by French authorities in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis on Wednesday, French authorities say.Abdelhamid Abaaoud was a Belgian national in his late 20s. Authorities believe that Abaaoud was close to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi.During a press conference, Minister of the Interior Bernard Cazeneuve said that Abaaoud was believed to be responsible for planning many of the Islamic State attacks in Europe.Of the six planned attacks that have been foiled in France, he said, Abaaoud was believed to have been involved in four of them. Authorities believe he orchestrated the the three teams that attacked six locations across Paris and killed 129 people.Announcing his death, Cazeneuve said that as promised, ""the Republic is doing everything it can to destroy terrorism.""The Saint-Denis raid on Wednesday were bloody and violent. Police fired more than 5,000 rounds and one suspect — presumed to be a woman — detonated a suicide vest. Another suspect, whom we can now assume was Abaaoud, was killed by either gunfire or a grenade explosion during the confrontation with police.Yesterday, authorities said because of the carnage, forensic evidence had to be used to identify the dead. Today, Paris Prosecutor François Molins said that Abaaoud's was identified using fingerprints.As we've reported, until recently authorities believed that Abaaoud was issuing orders from Syria. Cazeneuve said that authorities knew that he had left for Syria in 2014, but they had no indication that he had come back to Europe.However, three days after the Paris attacks on Nov. 16, Cazeneuve said they received a tip from an ""intelligence service outside of Europe,"" saying they had picked up signals that Abaaoud had passed through Greece. Authorities across the world knew, he said, that an international warrant had been issued for Abaaoud's arrest. The implication there is that somehow Abaaoud's presence in Europe had fallen through the cracks.Cazeneuve added that he has called for a meeting with other European countries to talk about ways they can bolster cooperation on border controls and the fight against weapons trafficking.""Things are not going far enough. Things are not moving fast enough,"" Cazeneuve said. ""Europe owes it to all the victims of terrorism to act.""NPR's Dina Temple-Raston reports that the fate of Salah Abdeslam, whom police say was a key operative in the attacks, is still unknown. Another unidentified suspect may also still be on the loose.Meanwhile, in Belgium, police conducted raids at six locations across Brussels, including some in the Molenbeek suburb, which has become notorious for producing radicalized youth.NPR's Peter Kenyon reports that officials say they are looking for associates of Bilal Hadfi, one of the Islamist attackers who died during the Paris killings on Friday. Hadfi was one of two terrorists who detonated explosive vests just outside a packed stadium in north Paris.This is a breaking news story, we'll update this post with the latest as we get it, so make sure to refresh this page.Update at 8:11 a.m. ET.

"U.S. counterterrorism officials are reviewing databases of known terror suspects and other materials after the deadly Paris shooting Wednesday morning, as the Obama administration opened the door to increasing security in the U.S. in response.The terror attack on a satirical French publication known for lampooning Islam left at least 12 dead, and the attackers remain at large. U.S. officials already are in touch with their French counterparts.The attackers reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar,"" Arabic for ""God is great, before escaping.Two French officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, named the suspects to the Associated Press as Frenchmen Said Kouachi and Cherif Kouachi, in their early 30s, as well as 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad, whose nationality wasn't immediately clear.One of the officials said they were linked to a Yemeni terrorist network.All three remain at large.Cherif Kouachi was convicted in 2008 of terrorism charges for helping funnel fighters to Iraq's insurgency and sentenced to 18 months in prison.Fox News is told investigators had been reviewing terror databases, including for individuals who have traveled to Syria. They also looked to closed-circuit television and evidence from the crime scene.In addition to identifying the suspects, the focus will be on determining whether this is isolated or part of a series of attacks.It is thought to be an attack carried out by a small cell, which distinguishes this from recent lone-wolf attacks, including one in Ottawa, Canada, and another more recent attack in Sydney, Australia. Officials are looking at the level of premeditation, given eyewitness accounts that the gunmen asked for individuals by name as they stormed the office.In addition, Fox News is told the assailants showed skill and familiarity with their weapons, and their escape also showed premeditation.A Department of Homeland Security official told Fox News that the department is ""closely monitoring"" the situation.""DHS will not hesitate to adjust our security posture, as appropriate, to protect the American people,"" the official said, urging the public to report suspicious activity to law enforcement.However, the office of the U.S. Embassy in France tweeted that there are ""no plans"" to close the embassy in Paris or other diplomatic facilities in France despite ""misleading"" press reports.U.S. investigators are expected to get more formally involved, but only after a request from the French government.Based on conversations with government officials and analysts, they are looking at three categories of suspects: self-radicalized individuals; members of Al Qaeda and its affiliates, specifically Al Qaeda's offshoot in North Africa known as AQIM; and those who have traveled to Syria and gotten training from Al Qaeda or the Islamic State.The latest edition of Inspire magazine, from the Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen, calls for attacks on France, as well as America and other allies.Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., told Fox News he has confidence in French authorities who are pursuing suspects as well. ""I would think that one way or the other, they will find them,"" he said.King also said the attack should be a ""wake-up call"" for Congress not to cut funding for DHS, despite an ongoing fight over funding the administration's immigration initiatives.Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C.

"Obama On Climate Change: 'I Actually Think We're Going To Solve This Thing'""I actually think we're going to solve this thing.""That's what President Obama said in a news conference just before he left a United Nations summit on climate change.""Climate change is a massive problem,"" Obama said. ""It is a generational problem. It's a problem that by definition is just about the hardest thing for a political system to absorb, because the effects are gradual, they're diffused. And yet despite all that ... I'm optimistic. I think we're going to solve it.""Just a few years ago, Obama said, nobody would have predicted that more than 150 leaders would come to Paris holding plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions.""All of this will be hard,"" Obama said. ""Getting 200 nations to agree on anything is hard ... but I'm convinced that we're going to get big things done here.""Obama leaves the conference, but his deputies will remain in Paris in an effort to craft a global, legally binding agreement intended to curb climate change. The big goal: to keep the global temperature from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius.At the moment, if you add up all the commitments on the table at the summit and assume that they would be met, the temperature would still rise by 2.7 degrees, Obama said.""That's too high,"" Obama said. But ""what we expect is that we'll hit these targets faster than expected and ... we could pick up the pace.""Obama said that is not just ""foolish optimism"" but an expectation based on past experience. The United States, for example, was able to meet its goals faster than expected.""The key here is to set up the structure so we're sending signals all around the world that says this is happening and we're not turning around,"" Obama said.Obama touched on a whole host of other issues during the conference. Here are a couple of highlights:— Obama says that the fact that the peace process for Syria is progressing in Vienna is a sign that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""realizes there is not going to be a military solution to the situation in Syria.""Eventually, Obama said, he expects the Russians to shift their focus in Syria from trying to prop up the regime of Bashar Assad to fighting the Islamic State.""I think Mr. Putin understands that for him to get bogged down in an inconclusive and paralyzing civil conflict is not the outcome that he is looking for,"" Obama said.In other words, Obama said, both the U.S. and Russia agree that the only lasting solution in Syria will be political.""Where we continue to have an ongoing difference is not in the need for a political settlement; it's whether Assad can continue to serve as president as that transition goes on,"" Obama said.Russia believes Assad should play a role, and Obama believes that ""it is impossible for Mr. Assad to bring that country together.""— On the shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado, Obama said Congress should act. Just as the country takes huge, costly steps to fight terrorism, it has to take steps to reduce gun homicides.""At the end of the day, Congress, states, local governments are going to have to act in order to make sure that we are preventing people who are deranged or have violent tendencies"" from getting weapons that magnify the damage that they can do, Obama said.Earlier in the day, President Obama urged Turkey and Russia to ease tensions by focusing on a common enemy: the Islamic State.The relationship between the two countries has been frayed since Turkey downed a Russian jet in November. Turkey has refused to apologize, saying the Russian warplane crossed over into Turkish airspace. Russia has implemented a series of sanctions.Reuters reports that Obama said the United States supported Turkey's right to defend its airspace, but he also urged the two countries to ""de-escalate tensions.""""We all have a common enemy. That is ISIL,"" Obama said using an acronym for the Islamic State, according to the AP. ""I want to make sure that we focus on that threat.""","If the original text is opinionated, rewrite it to present the information in an unbiased, journalistic news format.","President Obama delivered a news conference at the United Nations summit on climate change, where he expressed optimism about the possibility of addressing the issue.""I actually think we're going to solve this thing,"" Obama said.

"North Charleston Police Officer Michael T. Slager, 33, can be seen shooting 50-year-old Walter Scott after a confrontation on Saturday, according to The Post and Courier. Slager chases Scott and shoots at him eight times in the video recorded by a passerby and obtained by The New York Times.The confrontation started when Slager had reportedly pulled over Scott because of a broken taillight. It escalated into a foot chase as Scott allegedly fled because there were family court-issued warrants for his arrest. Slager pursued Scott into a grassy lot and claimed that he fired his Taser to subdue him.Earlier this week, an attorney for Slager said the cop felt threatened after Scott tried to overpower him and take his Taser. Today that attorney told The Post and Courier that he's ""no longer involved"" in the case.But first images in the video are of Slager shooting at Scott as he runs away from him. It also appears that Slager drops the Taser near Scott after he was gunned down, according to The New York Times.Police reports also say that responding officers performed CPR and delivered medical aid to Scott, but the video shows Scott face down in handcuffs for several minutes after the shooting. Another officer shows up and appears to give Scott aid, but never performs CPR.Police Chief Eddie Driggers said Tuesday that Slager had been arrested. The U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement that FBI investigators would work with the State Law Enforcement Division, which typically investigates officer-involved shootings in South Carolina, and the state’s attorney general to investigate any civil rights violations in Scott’s death. Mayor Keith Summey added during a news conference that as a result of the video and Slager’s “bad decision,” the officer would be charged with murder.Scott had been arrested about 10 times in the past, mostly for failing to pay child support or show up for hearings, according to the paper.""He has four children, he doesn’t have some type of big violent past or arrest record. He had a job, he was engaged,"" a lawyer for Scott's family told the Times. ""He had back child support and didn’t want to go to jail for back child support.""In a statement released Tuesday night, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley (R) said, ""What happened in this case is not acceptable in South Carolina."" Senator Tim Scott (R) said ""The senseless shooting and taking of Walter Scott's life was absolutely unnecessary and avoidable,"" adding that he would be watching the case closely.The shooting in North Charleston comes on the heels of several high-profile cases of police officers using deadly force against unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, Cleveland and New York. This is one of the few times the offending officer has been charged with murder.""What if there was no video? What if there was no witness? Where would we be without that video,"" Justin Bamberg said at a presser with the family on Tuesday night. Bamburg is one of the Scotts' family attorneys and also represents South Carolina's House District 90.Family attorney L. Chris Stewart called the witness who recorded the video a ""hero,"" saying that video evidence disproved initial reports that Scott reached for the Slager's Taser. Stewart added that the witness is working with investigators and may eventually come forward.""If there was no video, I do not believe that officer would be in jail,"" Bamberg said. ""From what the video shows, I think that provides the necessary ammunition to hold this officer accountable.""""I don't think anybody can see that and not see that what that officer did was murder Mr. Scott in cold blood,"" Bamberg said. ""What would have happened if this witness did not have the courage to stand up and do the right thing and decide that what he witnessed was wrong?

"A new national poll shows Vice President Biden faring better than Hillary Clinton in match-ups against top Republican presidential candidates, as the VP weighs jumping into the race -- and meets Thursday with a top labor leader.Fox News has learned that Biden is meeting later in the day with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka. This comes after he met last weekend with liberal icon, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.He's making the rounds amid a flurry of polls showing Clinton potentially vulnerable. The latest Quinnipiac University National Poll shows Clinton polling better than Biden – who is not a declared candidate – in the Democratic primary race. But the poll gives Biden the slight edge when squared against leading GOP contenders.""Note to Biden: They like you, they really like you, or they like you more than the others,” Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a statement.The poll shows Biden leading Republican front-runner Donald Trump, 48-40 percent. He also leads former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, 45-39 percent.The former secretary of state also edges those candidates, but not by as much.

"It seems almost quaint, really, to go back to the start of this presidential campaign when the question du jour was whether Chris ""just-sit-down-and-shut-up"" Christie was too much of a bully to become president. Temperament, it seems, was a requirement.Or even go back to Hillary Clinton's 2008 derision of Barack Obama as not ready to be president and take that 3 a.m. phone call about a national security crisis. Experience and depth of knowledge was also an issue.But that's ancient history. Somehow, the notions of temperament and experience have been overtaken by the desire -- at least according to the polls so far in the GOP race -- for what passes as a show of strength, unbound by convention and unattached to complexity. Donald Trump, the undisputed frontrunner, reigns supreme, no matter what the half-formed solutions. As in: Muslims are trying to kill us, so let's keep them out. Illegal immigrants are ""raping"" and taking our jobs, so let's keep them out. Civility -- now called political correctness -- is ruining our national conversation, so let's abandon it.The cliché is that presidential elections are about change, and that's true. Only this one may be about sea-change.This is not something that comes from nowhere, out of the blue. Americans are, with good reason, truly afraid. According to our CNN polling , nearly two thirds believe an act of terrorism is likely in the homeland -- and that poll was taken before the carnage of San Bernardino. Eighty-one percent are convinced that the terrorists are here, living among us -- a completely rational conclusion.Even more important -- and here's the key to Donald Trump's kingdom -- voters believe the political system, including (and maybe most of all) the President, have completely and utterly failed to get a handle on, or even appear to have a strategy for, security. And why would anybody blame anyone for thinking that? Sixty-eight percent say America's response to ISIS has not been tough enough, and a slightly smaller number say that when we do take action (in Iraq and Syria,) we fail. And that's not just among Republicans: Majorities in both parties say the United States has been ineffective in its response to the terror threat. This is not a new storyline. So this particular election-year story has all of the following: Disaffected and frustrated voters. Ineffective president. A level of public fear that has been rising steadily for at least a handful of years. Throw in anger at the collapsing political system, the establishment and the media, and Trump appears onstage like a vision emerging out of the clouds: the dark knight of our politics. Donald Trump is no fool. He's an experienced opportunist. He knows full well that he has stepped into a leadership vacuum that exists in American politics, and has been around for some time: Why should the American public have any respect at all for its institutions when they have been failing? When Congress can't legislate, or even behave? When the President -- elected with such high hopes -- fails to inspire or connect or even explain strategy? When others running for president often look like they're made of the same torn fabric, just with different holes? Trump flouts the conventions, and plays to fears. But for now, at least, it doesn't matter. In a large field of GOP candidates, Trump's solid core of support among one-third of Republicans -- a minority -- is enough to keep him on top, and any Republican running would like to have his numbers. His latest gambit -- a vague proposal to keep Muslims out of the country until ""our country's representatives can figure out what's going on"" is pure bombast, delivered to rally the faithful -- and he'll probably get a bump in the polls out of it. Jeb Bush calls it ""unhinged."" His fellow Republicans also punch at it, to varying degrees. But, for now at least, they're just punching jello. And hoping he doesn't break the mold.",Reframe the article to focus on future implications and predictions based on the events or information presented.,"The current political landscape presents a grim outlook, with a surge in public fear and a deeply fractured political system.

"WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - Republican senators warned Iran on Monday that any nuclear deal made with U.S. President Barack Obama could last only as long as he remains in office, in an unusual intervention into U.S. foreign policy-making.The letter, signed by 47 U.S. senators, says Congress plays a role in ratifying international agreements and points out that Obama will leave office in January 2017, while many in Congress will remain in Washington long after that.""We will consider any agreement regarding your nuclear-weapons program that is not approved by the Congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei,"" the letter read.""The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of an agreement at any time,"" it read.The letter, first reported by Bloomberg News, followed a speech to a joint meeting of Congress last week by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who warned that the United States was negotiating a ""bad deal"" with Tehran.It comes as world powers have been negotiating with Iran to try to reach some form of understanding by the end of March before a final deal in June that could ease crippling sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy.The U.S. Constitution divides foreign policy powers between the president and Congress. The executive branch is responsible for negotiating international agreements and lawmakers rarely intervene directly with the leaders of another nation while the president's administration is negotiating a pact.Republicans want any U.S. nuclear agreement with Iran to be approved by Congress. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who signed the letter released on Monday, agreed to postpone a vote on a bill requiring Obama to submit any deal for congressional approval amid outcry from Democrats.Along with McConnell, Republican signers include Tom Cotton, Orrin Hatch, John Cornyn, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, John Thune and Mark Kirk. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, two possible 2016 presidential contenders, also signed.

"Washington (CNN) Donald Trump backed off a false claim Friday morning, admitting he had not seen a video of a $400 million payment being unloaded from a US plane in Iran.The Republican nominee had claimed at rallies twice this week that such a video existed, saying in Maine on Thursday that it was provided by Iranians ""to embarrass our president because we have a president who's incompetent.""What Trump had actually seen in news reports was video of three American prisoners who Iran had released arriving in Geneva, Switzerland.Trump admitted his error in an early-morning tweet Friday, without actually saying he was wrong.""The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!"" he tweeted.The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!It was a rare reversal for Trump, who has stood by inaccurate or unproven claims previously -- insisting he'd seen videos of Muslim Americans in New Jersey cheering the September 11, 2001, attacks. His political rise began during the 2012 campaign, when he insisted that Obama release his birth certificate, questioning the President's American citizenship.Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine hit Trump on Friday for the video claim, saying he seems ""confused"" on CBS' ""This Morning,"" in an interview taped before Trump backtracked.""I have no idea what he's talking about. It (the video) doesn't exist. He might be thinking about Iran Contra from like 35 years ago or something like this,"" Kaine said.He pointed to Trump's recent criticism of Kaine, who Trump said in a late-July news conference ""did a terrible job in New Jersey"" -- despite Kaine being a governor and senator from Virginia, not New Jersey. Kaine said Trump must have confused him with Tom Kean, who was New Jersey's governor until 1990.""He was confusing it with a situation from two or three decades ago. Maybe that's what he's doing with this bogus video claim,"" Kaine said.Asked if he thinks Trump is confused, Kaine said: ""I absolutely think he's confused.""Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign chairman, responded to Kaine on Fox News Friday morning, saying he's ""not sure there was confusion"" on Trump's part.""The point that he was making is the cash-transfer took place and it was taking place consistent with the transfer of hostages,"" Manafort said.""Again, what the Obama administration wants to do is get off of the point. The point is, $400 million in cash that most likely ended up in terrorist camps used against the west was given in exchange for hostages and the President of the United States lied to the American people, that's the point.""Trump has made criticism of the US delivery of $400 million in cash via a plane to Iran -- the first installment of $1.7 billion in payments related to a decades-old dispute over an unfulfilled us arms purchase before the Iranian revolution cut relations between the two countries and settled at the same time Iran released four American prisoners -- a staple this week on the campaign trail.But Wednesday in Florida and Thursday in Maine, he went a step further, claiming he'd seen video of the cash actually being delivered in Iran.""It was interesting because a tape was made. Right? You saw that? With the airplane coming in -- nice plane -- and the airplane coming in, and the money coming off, I guess. Right? That was given to us, has to be, by the Iranians,"" Trump said in Portland, Maine.""And you know why the tape was given to us? Because they want to embarrass our country. They want to embarrass our country. And they want to embarrass our president because we have a president who's incompetent. They want to embarrass our president,"" Trump said. ""I mean, who would ever think they would be taking all of this money off the plane and then providing us with a tape? It's only for one reason. And it's very, very sad.""",Describe the events as if they were part of a historical epic tale.,"The Republican nominee had woven a tale of a video showcasing the illicit transfer of funds, but fate intervened, revealing the truth and casting doubt upon his credibility.The scene unfolded in the grand stage of Washington, where Trump, known for his captivating yet often inaccurate narratives, had claimed the existence of a video"
"To be fair, Clinton has been on the ugly end of Republican attacks for decades – a little guardedness is pardonable. But a play-it-safe approach seemed unnecessarily risky against an omnipresent juggernaut like Trump. The Republican nominee’s campaign depends upon free media. In many ways, what Trump says or does with his airtime is irrelevant – the point is to be seen and heard. He can lie and distort with impunity; his supporters don’t care and he dominates headlines all the same.With that in mind, I suggested Clinton’s plan to lay low and let surrogates do her bidding was a bad idea, and that she ought to steal the spotlight from Trump whenever and wherever she can. The same, I reasoned, was true for Democrats and down-ballot races.Democrats still shouldn’t take anything for granted, but I no longer believe there’s any reason to compete with Trump for airtime. If we’ve learned anything in the last couple of weeks, it’s that Trump will never morph into a sane, pragmatic candidate. He was never going to conform to political norms, but one assumed he would tone it down a bit as we approached November. Instead, he’s quadruple downed on his racist comments about a Mexican-American judge and, more recently, accused President Obama of being a Muslim Manchurian candidate who may or may not be complicit in the recent terror attacks in Orlando.Now that Trump is speaking to a general electorate, he’s paying a higher price for his racist drivel. Indeed, the latest NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll finds Hillary Clinton now leading Donald Trump nationally by eight points (49 percent to 41 percent). This gap will grow as Democrats unify and the Republican nominee continues unraveling in public. Even the political press is challenging Trump in ways that appear to have stunted his momentum.According to a Politico report, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid is now encouraging Democratic senate candidates to sit back and watch Trump discredit himself and everyone associated with him, including GOP candidates who’ve endorsed him. It’s a time-tested strategy: When your enemy is imploding, let him. And that’s what Democrats are doing. Calling it a “shock and blah campaign,” Politico reporter Burgess Everett writes: “The blah comes from the Democratic candidates themselves…They’re intentionally playing it safe and boring, figuring their elections will mostly be a referendum on Trump and that animosity toward the real estate magnate will put them over the top in key swing states.” To the extent that Democrats are attacking at all, they’re keeping it simple. Every interview, every question, and every speech returns to a common theme: Look who’s at the top of the Republican ticket? Is this what the GOP stands for? Is this a candidate Republicans are willing to co-sign? “If there was ever a national election,” said Dem. Senator Chuck Schumer, “This is it.” Trump’s campaign is a dumpster fire riding a wave of nativist angst. Why not make every race on the ballot a referendum on him? What works for Democratic senate candidates will also work for Hillary Clinton. There are obvious differences between senate races and a presidential contest, but the general strategy ought to work in both domains. Clinton will have to face the cameras and engage much more than down-ballot candidates. However, if this is who Trump is going to be, then merely looking and sounding like an adult will be enough for Clinton.","Convert the article into a lesson plan, outlining educational activities based on the content.",****Lesson Plan****Subject:** Political Science**Grade Level:** 10th-12th**Time:** 45 minutes**Objectives:*** Students will be able to identify the key points of the article.* Students will be able to explain the impact of Trump's campaign on the Democratic Party.* Students will be able to discuss the potential impact of the election on the United States.**Materials:**

"The Islamic faith isn’t “consistent” with the U.S. Constitution, and a Muslim shouldn’t be president, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said.“I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation,” Carson said on NBC’s 'Meet the Press' on Sunday.  Late Sunday, he doubled down on those comments in an interview with The Hill.  “I do not believe Sharia is consistent with the Constitution of this country,” Carson told The Hill. “Muslims feel that their religion is very much a part of your public life and what you do as a public official, and that’s inconsistent with our principles and our Constitution.”Editor's Note: Is Ben Carson Your Candidate for 2016?

"WASHINGTON -- Senate leaders announced Tuesday that they've resolved a weeks-long standoff over a sex trafficking bill containing controversial anti-abortion language, clearing the way, at last, for U.S. attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch to get her confirmation vote.Lynch has been waiting for more than five months for a confirmation vote. Most recently, Republican leaders tied the vote to passage of the trafficking bill. That bill has nothing to do with Lynch, but as long as it wasn't moving, neither was Lynch's confirmation.Aides to Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas) have been working for weeks to break the impasse. As introduced, the bill would have collected fees from sex traffickers and put them into a new victims fund that would be subject to the Hyde Amendment, the federal provision that bars the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape and incest. Democrats objected to the abortion language in general, but more so because the bill expanded the Hyde Amendment to include private funds.Under the deal announced Tuesday, the bill will create two funding streams. The first one flows from fines collected from sex traffickers, and would be used for survivor services excluding health care. This stream would not include Hyde Amendment restrictions. The second one would come from community health center funds that are already subject to the abortion limits.The deal lets both parties walk away with a solid talking point: Democrats can celebrate that they prevented an expansion of Hyde, while Republicans can say they didn't cave on restricting abortion funds.""I’m pleased that we were able to reach a deal that gets this done in a way that does not expand restrictions on women’s health to non-taxpayer dollars or to new programs, and provides survivors with real dedicated funds for the support and services they need,"" Murray said on the Senate floor.A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he expects the Senate to pass the sex trafficking bill on Wednesday.

"Shouts of “shame, shame, shame” erupted in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday as Republican lawmakers narrowly defeated legislation to protect the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees of government contractors.The measure, an amendment to a veterans and military construction spending bill introduced by New York Democrat Sean Maloney, initially had enough “yes” votes to pass, according to the count in the House chamber.But House Republican leaders extended the time allowed for the vote as they urged enough party members to change their positions to defeat it by a vote of 213 to 212.All 183 Democrats who voted backed the amendment, joined by 29 Republicans. All 213 “no’s” were from Republicans. Eight House members – three Republicans and five Democrats – did not vote.LGBT rights have been a hot-button issue during the 2016 election season. National politics have featured debate over whether making cakes for same-sex couples violates bakers’ religious freedom or whether the government should decide which public bathrooms are used by transgender people.Democrats chanted “shame, shame, shame” at Republicans, drawing attention to the vote. Steny Hoyer, the number two House Democrat, denounced it in a fiery speech. “We had 217 people for non-discrimination right up until the last moment,” he said.Thursday’s emotional vote came hours after the House late on Wednesday passed a $602 billion defense authorization bill that included “religious freedom” language that critics said would allow contractors to discriminate against LGBT individuals.The House Rules committee had angered Democrats by voting along party lines late on Tuesday not to allow a vote on an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would have eliminated that language.Republicans who backed the provision said it was necessary to protect the religious rights of military contractors and not intended to be discriminatory.","Convert the article into a detective's notebook, piecing together clues from the story.","S.

"For the first time in months, a national poll shows Donald Trump is not leading the Republican 2016 primary race, and instead has Ben Carson in first place.Carson won the support of 26% of Republican primary voters, compared to 22% who are backing Trump, according to CBS News/New York Times .

The conference runs through the weekend, providing well-heeled donors in the Koch network a chance to get acquainted with likely candidates.The live-streaming marks a break with barring reporters from covering the conferences.

"The 62-38 vote to end debate on the bill, moving it toward a final vote, was a victory for Obama, who had linked with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, to push the bill despite opposition from Senate Democratic leaders.""This last vote was a major step forward on this important legislation,"" said Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Republican who sponsored the bill.The Senate is now set to vote on changes to the bill, including one that would force the Obama administration to use trade deals to crack down on countries that manipulate the value of their currencies to give their exports a price advantage in the United States — an amendment the White House opposes because it would add a huge new complication into trade negotiations.Even though Senate passage is ultimately now much more likely, the House could be tougher. There, tea party conservatives are linking up with liberals to form a broader populist opposition than what existed in the Senate.The measure would hand the President six years' worth of ""trade promotion authority"" — the power to submit trade deals to Congress for an up-or-down vote with limited debate and no amendments. It's considered crucial to finalizing the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive trade deal that serves as the economic underpinning of Obama's ""Asia pivot.""

The trade deal has launched an obscure commerce policy discussion into a fiery political battle that has positioned the President at odds with most of his party, particularly Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and driven a wedge between the Democratic presidential front-runner, Hillary Clinton, and her primary challengers. The Senate is also looking to dispense with the trade votes to move forward and take up bills to reform or reauthorize the Patriot Act, an issue that considers to deeply divide the Senate and Republicans on Capitol Hill. The House overwhelmingly passed the USA Freedom Act, a bipartisan bill to reform the Patriot Act and effectively end the National Security Agency's bulk collection of phone data on millions of Americans. And while that bill was the result of a compromise between reform advocates and House Republican leadership, the bill is facing tough opposition in the Senate from powerful Republicans like McConnell, though the majority leader has vowed to allow a vote on the reform measure.

"Voters say the top issues facing the country are the economy and terrorism. They think Donald Trump will handle one of them better than Hillary Clinton, while the candidates tie on the other.A new Fox News Poll on the 2016 election finds more voters trust Trump than Clinton on the economy (+5 points). He also bests Clinton on handling the federal deficit (+5 points). Those are the only issues where he comes out on top.It’s a draw on “terrorism and national security,” as the candidates receive 47 percent apiece. In May, Trump led Clinton by 12 points on doing a better job on “terrorism” (52-40 percent).Equal numbers of voters say the economy and terrorism are the most important issues facing the country today (22 percent each). Education is the only other one to receive double-digit mentions (11 percent). Here’s the rest of the list: race relations (9 percent), the federal deficit (5 percent), health care (5 percent), climate change (4 percent), immigration (3 percent), foreign policy (3 percent), and drug addiction (2 percent).Clinton beats Trump by wide margins on education (+23 points), and on the lower priority concerns: climate change (+31 points), race relations (+28 points), drug addiction (+19 points), foreign policy (+16 points), and health care (+11 points).

"Not all the claims in the vice presidential debate stand up to scrutiny. A look at some of them and how they compare with the facts:REPUBLICAN MIKE PENCE: ""The fact that under this past administration, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious.... Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same.""THE FACTS: As a share of the total U.S. economy, the national debt has gone up 35 percent; not a doubling.Still, the debt has ballooned to $19.6 trillion. This largely reflected efforts by the Obama administration to stop the Great Recession.Would Clinton similarly increase the debt? Not according to an analysis by the independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.The Clinton plan with its tax increases would increase the gross debt -- both privately and publicly held-- by $450 billion over 10 years. Mind you, that is on top of an $8.8 trillion increase already projected by the government under current law.As for Donald Trump, the committee says his tax-cut-heavy plan would increase the gross debt by $4.3 trillion --nearly 10 times more than Clinton's plan would do.DEMOCRAT TIM KAINE, on fighting the Islamic State: ""Donald Trump doesn't have a plan.""THE FACTS: Clinton also doesn't have a plan that is materially different than what President Barack Obama is already doing.She's described a three-part strategy that involves crushing IS ""on its home turf"" in the Middle East, disrupting its infrastructure on the ground and online, and protecting America and its allies. All are current elements of the Obama administration's strategy, so it's not clear what would change or if she would accelerate any portions of it.It's also the case that Trump has not laid out a clear plan.PENCE, calling Clinton the ""architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy,"" says the crisis in Syria was the result of a ""failed and weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead.""THE FACTS: Clinton, as secretary of state, actually pushed for increased U.S. intervention after Syrian President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons against rebels. But Obama is the commander in chief and nothing has swayed him thus far. Whatever her failings might be on foreign policy, it's a stretch to accuse her of helping to lead a weak policy on Syria.PENCE: ""We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal.""THE FACTS: The coal industry's woes don't come solely from onerous federal regulations. Pence omitted the effects of steep competition from cheap natural gas.A string of major coal companies have filed for bankruptcy in recent years, including Arch Coal, Alpha Natural Resources and Peabody Energy. Layoffs and cutbacks have spread economic suffering through coal country in the Appalachians and Wyoming's Powder River Basin. By contrast, these are boom times for natural gas extraction, mostly due to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.Still, the Obama administration has implemented rules that aren't making the coal industry's life any easier. Obama last year imposed a rule requiring coal-fired power plants to cut their carbon emissions as part of his effort to combat climate change. The rule has been suspended pending a legal challenge. Obama also has halted new coal leases on federal lands until it completes a comprehensive review.PENCE, saying he's proud that ""the state of Indiana has balanced budgets.""THE FACTS: True, but that's not exactly to his credit as governor of Indiana. A balanced budget is required by law, as it is in every state except Vermont.","Propose as a community project plan, inspired by solutions mentioned or implied in the text.","It mainly focuses on the economic and foreign policy aspects of the claims.**Economic Claims:*** **National debt:** Pence claims that the national debt has doubled under the Obama administration.

"State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday that an unknown U.S. official made a request over the phone to delete several minutes of a December 2013 video of the exchange between reporters and a State Department spokeswoman. The State Department routinely posts on its site the briefing that it holds nearly every day with the diplomatic press corps.Kirby said the department technician who made the edit could not recall who requested it.The deleted portion of the video involves questions about a previous press briefing in 2012 in which then-State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland denied secret talks between the U.S. and Iran about a potential nuclear deal were taking place.After it was revealed in December 2013 that secret talks between the U.S. and Iran actually had taken place, then-spokeswoman Jen Psaki admitted the administration lied in order to protect the secret negotiations.Earlier this month Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes acknowledged to The New York Times that the administration was deceptive about the talks, creating a ""narrative"" that they did not take place. When James Rosen of Fox News -- who asked the original questions of Psaki -- tried to refer back to the video last month, he found the exchange had been deleted. Kirby, who originally called the deletion a ""glitch,"" said Wednesday that he asked State Department lawyers to look into the matter after being notified about the omission. ""They learned that a specific request was made to excise that portion of the briefing. We do not know who made the request to edit the video or why it was made,"" Kirby said. Another senior State Department official said the technician found the request ""unusual"" and consulted her supervisor before making the edit. The supervisor, who also could not remember the name of the person who called, approved the request because it came from someone ""from a certain level and credibility"" in the Department of Public Affairs. ""Although this person did not remember the person who called her, or the person they were calling on behalf of, she remembers it was not (Jen) Psaki,"" this official said. ""Jen did not request it, did not know about it and had nothing to do with it."" Psaki, who now is the White House communications director, tweeted Wednesday that she was unaware of the episode: ""I had no knowledge of nor would I have approved of any form of editing or cutting my briefing transcript on any subject while @StateDept."" Kirby noted that the full briefing transcript, including the exchange on Iran, had always been available on the State Department website and that the omitted video has since been replaced with a complete version that had been archived with the Defense Department. He said that was the only instance he was aware of in which briefing videos were edited, though he couldn't be sure there weren't others. He announced a new policy Wednesday in which every video would be posted immediately with all edits disclosed. ""To my surprise, the Bureau of Public Affairs did not have in place any rules governing this type of action,"" he said. ""Therefore, we are taking immediate steps to craft appropriate protocols on this issue, as we believe that deliberately removing a portion of the video was not and is not in keeping with the State Department's commitment to transparency and public accountability."" Because such rules weren't previously in place, Kirby said he found ""no reason"" to press forward with a more formal investigation.",Reframe the article to focus on future implications and predictions based on the events or information presented.,"The video, which was posted on the department's website, contained questions and answers about a previous press briefing in 2012 in which then-Spokeswoman Victoria Nuland denied secret talks between the U.S. and Iran about a potential nuclear deal.The revelation that"
"President Obama earned a double-barreled rebuke Monday from The Washington Post's fact-checker, for repeating a faulty claim that the Keystone XL pipeline ""bypasses"" the U.S. -- and for saying it would only carry ""Canadian oil.""The president made the claims in an interview last week with WDAY of Fargo, N.D. Obama continued to downplay the impact of the Canada-to-Texas oil pipeline, just days after vetoing a bipartisan-backed bill that would approve the construction project. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has teed up a vote to override that veto later this week.In the local interview, Obama said:""I've already said I'm happy to look at how we can increase pipeline production for U.S. oil, but Keystone is for Canadian oil to send that down to the Gulf. It bypasses the United States and is estimated to create a little over 250, maybe 300 permanent jobs. We should be focusing more broadly on American infrastructure for American jobs and American producers, and that's something that we very much support.""The president has been called out before for claiming the oil would bypass the U.S.Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler explained Monday that while the crude oil would travel to the Gulf Coast, it would then be refined into products like gasoline -- and much of it certainly would be used in the U.S.""Current trends suggest that only about half of that refined product would be exported, and it could easily be lower,"" Kessler said.He cited a February report by energy industry consultant IHS Energy, which predicted most of the refined products would likely be ""consumed in the United States.""Further, even the State Department issued a report downplaying the notion that a large amount of that crude would be exported, since foreign refiners would have to shoulder additional transportation charges.Kessler said with his recent comments, Obama ""appears to be purposely ignoring the findings of the lead Cabinet agency on the issue.""Further, he challenged Obama's claim that Keystone would just be for Canadian oil, since producers in North Dakota and Montana want to move oil from the Bakken area through it.Kessler gave Obama ""four Pinocchios"" for his comments -- the worst rating on his fact-check scale.""If he disagrees with the State Department's findings, he should begin to make the case why it is wrong, rather than assert the opposite, without any factual basis,"" Kessler wrote. ""Moreover, by telling North Dakota listeners that the pipeline has no benefit for Americans, he is again being misleading, given that producers in the region have signed contracts to transport some of their production through the pipeline.""McConnell is aiming for a final vote on the Keystone veto override on Wednesday, with a procedural vote set for Tuesday. So far, supporters of the pipeline have not demonstrated they have the necessary two-thirds majority in Congress to override.Obama, in opposing that bill, has argued the State Department needs to be allowed to finish its official review of the pipeline.","Rewrite the text as a wedding vow, romantically linking the themes or messages of the story.","My beloved, I stand before you today with a heart filled with love and gratitude.

"Under new overtime rules, employees will be injured as well.The Labor Department’s change to the overtime rule is a harsh blow to millions of small businesses and their employees. According to NFIB research, approximately 44% of small businesses would be affected. The department claims that 4.2 million workers could potentially benefit from the change. That’s not consistent with the department’s own analysis.In fact, buried within the regulation, the department projects that many workers won’t receive any additional pay and that others will lose pay. According to Labor, 60% of the newly eligible employees don’t work overtime right now. The department also estimates that the average hourly pay rate will decline in 2017. The talking points say this is a raise for workers, but the economic analysis says something completely different.Most small businesses have razor-thin margins, and they cannot simply raise prices to cover higher costs without losing customers. Moreover, the median personal income for small business owners is roughly $68,000 annually, according to NFIB research. Big corporations can trim shareholder dividends, cut CEO pay or move production facilities out of the country. Those aren’t options for most small firms.Employees will be injured as well. Managers who haven’t punched a clock in years will have to go back to filling out a time sheet. They will even have to take into account work from home such as checking email or fielding a phone call. Essentially, they’ll be demoted from their management positions to hourly jobs.The overtime rule is another government mandate that makes it costlier and more difficult to run a business and create jobs. NFIB surveys its members every month to identify their top concerns. Government regulations consistently rank at the top.Every minute that business owners must devote to keeping records, filling out paperwork and dealing with government inspectors is a minute they don’t have to run their businesses.

"More than half of these enrollees are new to the program, said Burwell, speaking at an event commemorating the close of the second open enrollment period for subsidized private health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act's exchange marketplaces. The enrollment total surpasses the Department of Health and Human Services' projections, but is lower than what the Congressional Budget Office expected.""Nearly 11.7 million Americans signed up or were re-enrolled through the marketplace as of Feb. 22,"" Burwell said. ""We are finally moving the needle on reducing the number of uninsured.""""We're confident that we will prevail in the court case argued before the Supreme Court last week. The law is clear,"" Burwell said Monday. ""The text and structure of the Affordable Care Act demonstrate that individuals in every state are eligible for tax credits. Those who support this lawsuit believe that the law should be dismantled or repealed, and they are content to roll back the progress that we have achieved.""Among the estimated 7.7 million enrollees from the federal health insurance exchanges, 87 percent received tax credits worth $263 a month on average, Burwell said. More than half the enrollees paid $100 or less a month, including their subsidies. ""These numbers show just how important the tax credits are to millions of Americans and to the insurance markets in those states and throughout the marketplace,"" she said.Federal officials and most state-run exchanges have allowed individuals with applications in process to complete them for about a week following the deadline. In addition, the federally managed exchanges serving more than 30 states, and the majority of the exchanges operated by 13 states and the District of Columbia, re-opened enrollment for people who learn when they file their income taxes that they owe a fine under the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate that most U.S. residents have health coverage.The numbers Burwell announced Monday are 300,000 higher than those reported by the White House last month. Although additional tax season sign-ups are likely to boost the tally, enrollment is expected to decline over the course of the year as consumers obtain health coverage through another source, like a job, or as they give up their policies and become uninsured.""While we know that the numbers will change as the year continues, we are pleased with the results today,"" Burwell said.The number of sign-ups Burwell announced Monday doesn't reflect how many of those enrollees have begun paying for their insurance policies, which is necessary to secure coverage. During the 2014 enrollment campaign, the number of enrollees surpassed 8 million, but fell below 7 million within six months.During the year, people can use the exchanges to buy insurance if they experience a life change, such as having a baby or getting married. Open enrollment for 2016 coverage begins Nov. 1, 2015, and runs through Jan. 31, 2016.The health insurance exchange figures announced Monday don't include new sign-ups for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. Nearly 11 million people have joined those programs since Obamacare enrollment began in October 2013, largely driven by the law's broadening of Medicaid eligibility. To date, 28 states and the District of Columbia have opted into the Medicaid expansion.","Reframe the article as a motivational speech, inspiring action or change based on the content.","""Good morning, distinguished guests, and all of you gathered here today.

"With only about 70 days left until the election, presidential campaign politics have hit a new low. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has released a new attack ad claiming Republican rival Donald Trump is a candidate of racists.The new ad released by Clinton attempts to depict Trump as a racist, a candidate supported by white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan.In the campaign commercial, a KKK member is heard saying, ""The reason a lot of Klan members like Donald Trump is because a lot of what he believes we believe in.""Clinton said Trump and Republicans are reinforcing harmful stereotypes, calling it a disturbing preview of the kind of president Trump would be.""He is taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party,"" she said.Trump said the allegations are the oldest ploy in the Democratic playbook.""When Democratic policies fail, they are left with only this one, tired argument: 'you're racist, you're racist, you're racist!' Trump insisted.Trump said Clinton was not only attacking him, but millions of good Americans who support him.""She lies, she smears, she paints decent Americans as racists,"" said Trump, who then defended the core ideas of his candidacy.But Clinton isn't backing down. In a speech in the swing state of Nevada, she also tried to tie Trump to the so-called ""AltRight"" or ""alternative right,"" a very vocal group whose nationalist beliefs push beyond mainstream conservatism.""He's taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over one of America's two major political parties,"" she said.Trump's campaign said he's never used the term ""alt-right"" and disavows ""any groups or individuals associated with a message of hate.""""Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself!"" Trump tweeted.In New Hampshire Thursday, the GOP candidate said he doesn't want white supremacists to vote for him -- his campaign is about love for America, not hate.And although Clinton still leads in national polls, it may become more difficult for her in the days ahead to restore voter trust and deflect attention away from her email scandal.The battle over race took the spotlight temporarily off of Clinton's ongoing problems over her e-mails and the controversy over her connections between the Clinton Foundation and the U.S. State Department when she was Secretary of State.

"Obama To Limit Police Acquisition Of Some Military-Style EquipmentPresident Obama said military-style equipment used by police departments ""can alienate and intimidate local residents and send the wrong message,"" as he ended federal transfers of such weapons to local law enforcement.Obama's remarks, made in Camden, N.J., are an attempt to ease tensions between police and minority communities in the wake of several high-profile police-involved shootings.Under new recommendations, police forces will be banned from acquiring some types of military-style equipment from federal agencies. The proposal was one of several made by a White House task force that Obama is putting into place using an executive order on Monday.According to a report issued by the White House, the task force recommended banning the sale of some equipment — such as tracked armored vehicles, weaponized aircraft and high-caliber weapons and ammunition — after weighing their utility to local police and the ""the potential negative impact on the community if the equipment was used arbitrarily or inappropriately.""Local police departments can still buy this equipment on their own.

"WASHINGTON –- Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign on Wednesday announced a massive fundraising haul in the quarter that ended on June 30, further cementing her status as the clear front-runner in the 2016 race.All told, the Democratic candidate and former secretary of state raised more than $45 million in primary campaign contributions between her campaign announcement in April and the end of June. That figure, according to a Clinton aide, is the most that any candidate has ever raised in their opening quarter, topping President Barack Obama's roughly $42 million in the first quarter of 2011.Clinton's haul would also shatter the previous record for an opening fundraising total by a non-incumbent presidential candidate, which she herself set in the first quarter of 2007. To set that record, she raised $26 million in the first three months of her first presidential campaign while transferring an additional $10 million from her Senate campaign account. At the time, Obama trailed closely behind with $25 million.The Clinton campaign will also report that 91 percent of the donations it received were $100 or less in value. However, the Clinton aide did not have a total for how many individual donors gave to the campaign.",Reframe the text as an open letter to a public figure or organization mentioned in the story.,"Dear Secretary Clinton,I am writing to you as a concerned citizen and admirer of your unwavering dedication to public service.

"U.S. counterterrorism officials are reviewing databases of known terror suspects and other materials after the deadly Paris shooting Wednesday morning, as the Obama administration opened the door to increasing security in the U.S. in response.The terror attack on a satirical French publication known for lampooning Islam left at least 12 dead, and the attackers remain at large. U.S. officials already are in touch with their French counterparts.The attackers reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar,"" Arabic for ""God is great, before escaping.Two French officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, named the suspects to the Associated Press as Frenchmen Said Kouachi and Cherif Kouachi, in their early 30s, as well as 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad, whose nationality wasn't immediately clear.One of the officials said they were linked to a Yemeni terrorist network.All three remain at large.Cherif Kouachi was convicted in 2008 of terrorism charges for helping funnel fighters to Iraq's insurgency and sentenced to 18 months in prison.Fox News is told investigators had been reviewing terror databases, including for individuals who have traveled to Syria. They also looked to closed-circuit television and evidence from the crime scene.In addition to identifying the suspects, the focus will be on determining whether this is isolated or part of a series of attacks.It is thought to be an attack carried out by a small cell, which distinguishes this from recent lone-wolf attacks, including one in Ottawa, Canada, and another more recent attack in Sydney, Australia. Officials are looking at the level of premeditation, given eyewitness accounts that the gunmen asked for individuals by name as they stormed the office.In addition, Fox News is told the assailants showed skill and familiarity with their weapons, and their escape also showed premeditation.A Department of Homeland Security official told Fox News that the department is ""closely monitoring"" the situation.""DHS will not hesitate to adjust our security posture, as appropriate, to protect the American people,"" the official said, urging the public to report suspicious activity to law enforcement.However, the office of the U.S. Embassy in France tweeted that there are ""no plans"" to close the embassy in Paris or other diplomatic facilities in France despite ""misleading"" press reports.U.S. investigators are expected to get more formally involved, but only after a request from the French government.Based on conversations with government officials and analysts, they are looking at three categories of suspects: self-radicalized individuals; members of Al Qaeda and its affiliates, specifically Al Qaeda's offshoot in North Africa known as AQIM; and those who have traveled to Syria and gotten training from Al Qaeda or the Islamic State.The latest edition of Inspire magazine, from the Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen, calls for attacks on France, as well as America and other allies.Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., told Fox News he has confidence in French authorities who are pursuing suspects as well. ""I would think that one way or the other, they will find them,"" he said.King also said the attack should be a ""wake-up call"" for Congress not to cut funding for DHS, despite an ongoing fight over funding the administration's immigration initiatives.Catherine Herridge is an award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, D.C.

"Raleigh, North Carolina (CNN) As soon as the first debate of the 2016 presidential election was over, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were quick to claim victory.But by the next morning, one of them had become far less cheerful.Just hours after Clinton and Trump clashed on stage at Hofstra University in one of the most highly anticipated political events in modern history, the two presidential nominees took markedly different tones as they reflected on the previous night's debate.Clinton and her aides showed all of the outward signs of a team riding high.The Democratic nominee boarded her plane at Westchester County Airport to applause and cheers from her staff. Before taking off to Raleigh, North Carolina, for a campaign rally, a smiling candidate walked to the back of the plane to gloat to reporters about a ""great, great"" evening""One of my favorite baseball players growing up, Ernie Banks, used to get so excited about going to play that he would say, 'Lets play two,'"" Clinton said. ""So I am looking forward to the next debate and the one after that.""And taking a dig at Trump's complaint after the debate that he was given a ""defective"" microphone, Clinton quipped: ""Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night.""And in fact, the Republican nominee did not appear to be having a good morning.Calling into Fox News' ""Fox & Friends"" early Tuesday, Trump rattled off more than one complaint about the debate.Those compliments were long gone.""I had some hostile questions,"" Trump said on Fox News. ""He didn't ask her about the emails at all. He didn't ask her about her scandals. He didn't ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed. He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. There's no question about it.""Trump was still irritated -- and even conspiratorial -- about his microphone.""My microphone was terrible,"" Trump complained. ""I wonder: was it set up that way on purpose?""To top things off, Trump unloaded on former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who has alleged that the businessman's disparaging treatment of her had led to eating disorders and depression.With no apparent consideration for the political recklessness of his crude comments, Trump once again went after Machado's physical appearance, bringing her up on his own.""That person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst. The absolute worst,"" Trump said. ""She gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem. We had a real problem.""Those remarks could prove to be detrimental for a candidate already struggling with women voters and with the perception that he lacks the temperament to be president.Late Monday, the Clinton campaign released a new video featuring Machado. ""He'd tell me, 'You look ugly,' or, 'You look fat,'"" Machado says in the video. ""Sometimes he'd 'play' with me and say: 'Hello, Miss Piggy,' 'Hello, Miss Housekeeping.'""Machado also held a press call Tuesday afternoon to respond to Trump's comments and express her support for Clinton. She told reporters that watching the 2016 election was like a ""really bad dream.""""I never imagined in 20 years later I will be in this position,"" she said. ""Watching this guy again doing stupid things and stupid comments.""Speaking in Raleigh Tuesday afternoon, Clinton continued to make digs at Trump's debate performance, saying it was ""very clear that he didn't prepare.""""What we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent,"" she said. ""It's unclear exactly what he is saying, but words matter.""Marguerite Scott, a retired 68-year-old woman from Cary, North Carolina, who attended the Raleigh campaign event, said she was struck by Trump appearing to lose his composure during the debate. Scott lso chastised the GOP nominee for his comments Tuesday about Machado.""Men in general should stop objectifying women. If she is fat, that is her business,"" Scott said. ""And to put her on blast like that shows what a misogynist person he is.""","Convert the article into a narrative, telling the story through the experiences of individuals directly affected by the events.","The 2016 presidential election debate had a profound impact on the lives of individuals across the country.

"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump landed his first major newspaper endorsement Sunday as the Las Vegas Review-Journal proclaimed its support for the embattled nominee.  ""History tells us that agents for reform often generate fear and alarm among those intent on preserving their cushy sinecures,"" the paper said.""It’s hardly a shock, then, that the 2016 campaign has produced a barrage of unceasing vitriol directed toward Mr. Trump. But let us not be distracted by the social media sideshows and carnival clatter. Substantive issues are in play this November,"" it stated.  The Review-Journal represented Trump's first endorsement from a major newspaper, most of which have backed his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, or simply opposed the real estate tycoon. The Review-Journal is owned by casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who reportedly has become disillusioned with Trump.Dozens of major newspapers have endorsed Clinton.

"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said Tuesday that he was ""very interested"" in a possible run for president on 2016, hours after he announced the launch of a new political committee.In an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Walker said he was considering a run for the same reason he initially ran for governor of Wisconsin in 2010.""[My wife and I] were afraid that our sons were growing up in a state that wasn't as great as the one we grew up in,"" Walker, 47, said."" I have the same worries about this country for my sons today that I had for my state many years ago.""Walker, who gave a well-received speech to a forum of conservative voters in Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday, set up the committee “Our American Revival” on Jan. 16. A new website for the so-called 527 organization, which will help him get his message out as he works toward building his political clout, went live Tuesday morning.""Our American Revival encompasses the shared values that make our country great,"" Walker said in a written statement. He called for ""limiting the powers of the federal government to those defined in the Constitution while creating a leaner, more efficient, more effective and more accountable government to the American people.""Walker echoed that refrain on ""Hannity"" and played up his status as a Washington outsider.""I think we need new bold leadership from outside of Washington that's proven to take on the challenges that we face in this country right now,"" Walker said. ""The ideas that are going to transform America aren't coming from people in Washington. They're coming from our state leaders ... I think there's a sense out there, which I heard on Saturday, that people don't just want dynamic speakers. They want people who've got a proven record, who've actually done something, not just talked about it.""""If we're going to take [former Secretary of State and presumptive Democratic nominee] Hillary Clinton on,"" Walker added,"" we've got to have a name from the future, not one from the past, in an apparent shot at 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.Walker’s steps are in stride with other prospective candidates, like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who earlier this week launched a political action committee.During his speech Saturday in Iowa, home of the first-in-the-country caucus, Walker drew on his highly publicized battle with unions in his home state and told an emotional story of how he and his family received death threats for speaking out against the groups.“If you are not afraid to go big and bold, you can actually get results,” he told the crowd.Following his speech at the Iowa Freedom Summit, Walker went west – attending an event in California hosted by the billionaire Koch brothers.","Reframe the text as an escape room scenario, with puzzles and challenges based on the story.","You find yourself trapped in a political labyrinth, where the stakes are high and the challenges are formidable.

"Encouraged by a new poll giving him a double-digit lead in the state and eager to pivot to the general election, the Republican front-runner stressed the importance of Indiana's Tuesday GOP primary more than he or his top advisers have previously.""Indiana is so important and we have to win it,"" Trump said to a crowd of approximately 1,500 people packed into a theater here in Terre Haute, Indiana. ""If we win Indiana, it's over.""While also echoing his top advisers' comments that he can clinch the nomination without Indiana's 57-delegate prize, Trump urged Indiana Republicans to put him over the top -- a victory that would solidify Trump's increasingly clear path to winning the GOP nomination on the first ballot of the party's summer convention.Still, Trump didn't relent in his attacks against the Texas senator, whom Trump accused of being a liar. Trump also focused on Cruz's now non-existent path to winning the GOP nomination on the first ballot of the convention and mocked Cruz for announcing a running mate , former GOP candidate and businesswoman Carly Fiorina , under those circumstances. Cruz can only stake a claim to win his party's nomination if he can keep Trump from clinching the 1,237 delegates needed before the party's July convention.""I've been saying that!"" Trump exclaimed.Cruz was born in Canada to an American citizen mother -- his Cuban-born father later became a citizen. Trump has that used to claim Cruz is not a ""natural-born citizen"" and therefore ineligible to be president.The Cruz campaign did not respond to a request for comment.A win in Indiana Tuesday could depress Trump's rivals' hopes of keeping him from the 1,237 delegate mark necessary for a GOP nomination win. Trump suggested Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- who formed a pact with Cruz to stay out of Indiana and focus on other states -- might drop out if Trump triumphs in the Hoosier State.That, Trump said, would give him a chance to try and bring much-needed unity to a fractured Republican Party.""It's really important that we win because if we win -- you know, we want to raise money for the party and we want to raise money for the Senate races and the congressional races and do a lot of things instead of wasting our time with these people,"" Trump said.But Trump's ongoing primary battle didn't stop him on Sunday from knocking the former secretary of state repeatedly before a rowdy crowd of Hoosier supporters.Still, he pressed a plea for Indiana voters to deliver him a victory Tuesday that he said would empower him to focus on Clinton.""Please. Let's focus on Hillary,"" he said.","Conceive as a children's book story, simplifying complex ideas into engaging narratives.","He claimed that a win in Indiana would put him in a strong position to clinch the nomination.Trump spoke to a crowd of about 1,500 people and urged Indiana Republicans to support him.

"President Barack Obama said the U.S. and its allies must strip away any legitimacy that Islamic State and al-Qaeda claim by portraying themselves as religious movements.Obama, who has come under criticism from Republicans who say he avoids acknowledging the Muslim roots of extremist groups, said terrorists use religion as a recruiting tool by portraying the U.S. and European nations as being at war with Islam.“We must never accept the premise they put forward, because it is a lie,” Obama said Wednesday in Washington on the second day of a White House summit on combating extremism. “They are not religious leaders. They’re terrorists. And we are not at war with Islam. We are at war with people who have perverted Islam.”Deadly attacks in Paris, Sydney and Copenhagen by individuals of Muslim background and possibly inspired by the brutal tactics of Islamic State, along with the group’s spread in Syria, Iraq and now Libya, have raised alarms in Europe and the U.S. about the danger of lone-wolf terrorists, driven by extremist ideology and difficult to detect before they act.At the summit, the Obama administration is convening representatives of Muslim organizations, law enforcement officials and local political leaders to swap ideas about how to stem root causes of extremism. It also has invited leaders from overseas to take part.Obama said civic leaders must recognize that Islamic State and al-Qaeda “deliberately target their propaganda in the hopes of reaching and brainwashing young Muslims” through videos, social media and other online outlets. He said the one way to counter that is to alleviate the alienation and poverty that are the extremists’ best recruiting tool.In the U.S., he said, local and federal authorities must make sure that Muslims aren’t isolated and that they are welcomed and integrated into society.“Muslim Americans feel they have been unfairly targeted,” he said. “We have to be sure that abuses stop, are not repeated, that we do not stigmatize entire communities.”Former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore, who is chairman of a political action committee aimed at electing Republicans, called the conference a “farce” in a statement and said the administration should be targeting terrorists rather than offering “pie-in-the-sky social welfare programs” to Muslims here and overseas.The administration’s strategy is also aimed at drawing in the domestic Muslim leaders who Obama is leaning on to identify and isolate potentially violent extremists. Yet some groups say they remain suspicious about the administration’s motivation.The Muslim Advocates, an Oakland Calif.-based group that that was invited to a White House meeting earlier this month, expressed concern that Obama’s requests for “partnerships” with Muslim community and religious leaders is code for requiring leaders to play a law enforcement role.They also blasted Obama for focusing too narrowly on Muslims, a decision that the group says reinforces a negative stereotype that Islam and terror are linked.“This whole day is focused on American Muslims, frankly,” Farhana Khera, the group’s executive director, said in a telephone interview. “It strikes at the core of what we are as Americans.”Obama is speaking on the topic again tomorrow at the State Department during a session that includes representatives from overseas, including France, Belgium, Mexico and Japan.",Present the information as a series of Instagram-style photo captions.,"**Captions:****1.** ""They call themselves religious leaders, but they're actually terrorists.

"He's combative. He rejects compromise as ""the mushy middle."" He's not inclined to wait his turn. And he doesn't seem to mind annoying his Republican elders with tactics that critics see as destructive and short-sighted.So perhaps it's no surprise that little more than two years after he was sworn in to the Senate, the 44-year-old Texan on Monday became the first contender to officially announce his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. He skipped the one-step-at-a-time tradition of announcing an ""exploratory"" committee to declare flatly that he was in the race.""It's going to take a new generation of courageous conservatives to help make America great again,"" Cruz said in a 30-second video he posted on Twitter early Monday morning, followed by a speech at Liberty University, ""and I'm ready to stand with you to lead the fight.""He won't be lonely for long. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is slated to announce his candidacy in two weeks, likely followed in short order by yet another Republican senator, Marco Rubio of Florida. That's not to mention the governors (Wisconsin's Scott Walker, New Jersey's Chris Christie, Louisiana's Bobby Jindal), the former governors (Florida's Jeb Bush, Texas' Rick Perry, Arkansas' Mike Huckabee), the former senators (Pennsylvania's Rick Santorum) and the others who already are visiting Iowa and New Hampshire and hiring staffers for nascent campaigns.At his speech, a handful of students in a prominent front row sported red ""Stand With Rand"" sweatshirts.Cruz has been overshadowed in recent months by Bush, Walker and other contenders who have more muscular fundraising networks and stronger institutional support. In the Senate, he has been more of an agitator than a legislator. Arizona Sen. John McCain, the GOP's 2008 nominee, once called him a ""wacko bird.""That said, Cruz is worth watching.For one thing, the skills he honed as a college debater at Princeton — he was named U.S. National Speaker of the Year in 1992 — should serve him well in the series of crowded primary debates.For another, while his Tea Party credentials might be a mixed blessing in a general election, in the primaries they align him with the most energized forces in the Republican grass roots today. That helped him upset the establishment's favorite, lieutenant governor David Dewhurst, for the Republican Senate nomination in 2012.What's more, the locale Cruz chose to make Monday's announcement reflects his efforts to broaden his electoral base by wooing Christian conservatives, another key group in the GOP coalition. He spoke at the Lynchburg, Va., school founded by evangelical leader Jerry Falwell that describes itself on its website as the largest Christian university in the world.His speech had the ring of the religious testimony of an evangelical church. He declared his opposition to abortion and his support of traditional marriage. He emotionally described how his father's embrace of Jesus saved his parents' marriage. His father, Rafael, a pastor at a suburban Dallas church, fled Castro's Cuba in 1957.Cruz's Cuban-American heritage would be a selling point for the Republican Party as it tries to reach out to Hispanic voters, although his hardline stance on immigration could be a complication with those voters. And speaking of biography, he has an education that might surprise those inclined to dismiss him: He was graduated from Princeton and then from Harvard Law School, magna cum laude, before clerking at the Supreme Court for Chief Justice William Rehnquist.At one point, he urged his audience to ""take out your cellphones"" and text the word ""Constitution"" or ""Liberty"" — ""we're flexible,"" he said — to a number linked to his campaign.","Outline as a debate club brief, with points for and against the main argument.",**Points for:*** **Strong debate skills:** Cruz's experience as a college debater could serve him well in the crowded primary debates.* **Alignment with Tea Party:** Cruz's Tea Party credentials align him with the most energized forces in the Republican grass roots.* **Broadening electoral base:** Cruz's choice of location
"Shouts of “shame, shame, shame” erupted in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday as Republican lawmakers narrowly defeated legislation to protect the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees of government contractors.The measure, an amendment to a veterans and military construction spending bill introduced by New York Democrat Sean Maloney, initially had enough “yes” votes to pass, according to the count in the House chamber.But House Republican leaders extended the time allowed for the vote as they urged enough party members to change their positions to defeat it by a vote of 213 to 212.All 183 Democrats who voted backed the amendment, joined by 29 Republicans. All 213 “no’s” were from Republicans. Eight House members – three Republicans and five Democrats – did not vote.LGBT rights have been a hot-button issue during the 2016 election season. National politics have featured debate over whether making cakes for same-sex couples violates bakers’ religious freedom or whether the government should decide which public bathrooms are used by transgender people.Democrats chanted “shame, shame, shame” at Republicans, drawing attention to the vote. Steny Hoyer, the number two House Democrat, denounced it in a fiery speech. “We had 217 people for non-discrimination right up until the last moment,” he said.Thursday’s emotional vote came hours after the House late on Wednesday passed a $602 billion defense authorization bill that included “religious freedom” language that critics said would allow contractors to discriminate against LGBT individuals.The House Rules committee had angered Democrats by voting along party lines late on Tuesday not to allow a vote on an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would have eliminated that language.Republicans who backed the provision said it was necessary to protect the religious rights of military contractors and not intended to be discriminatory.","Convert the news article into an opinion piece, providing a strong stance or viewpoint on the events or information discussed.","The recent events in the U.S. House of Representatives regarding the protection of civil rights for LGBT employees of government contractors are a matter of grave concern.

In Nevada, ""you have the chance to do it and you're going to do it,"" Johnson said of the November referendum that could legalize recreational marijuana for users over the age of 21.They remain hopeful about reaching the Commission on Presidential Debates 15 percent in five polls threshold, even if perhaps not by the first one:Weld raised the possibility that even if they can't reach the polling benchmark by the first debate, slated for Sept. 26, that if polling continues they could reach eligibility for a later debate. The last presidential debate is slated for Oct. 19 at UNLV. Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol spokesman Joe Brezny, who ran the Nevada campaign for Mitt Romney's presidential bid four years ago, said Thursday that he's supporting Johnson and Weld and noted of Republicans that he ""watched some good people nominate the least electable person in mankind.""....Weld contended to cheers that the fiscal conservatism he and Johnson demonstrated in their gubernatorial tenures is just what's needed in Washington D.C. Johnson, meanwhile, pledged that if elected, he would present Congress with a balanced budget within the first 100 days of taking the White House.• Montanan political analysts and watchers think Johnson could easily double his 3 percent from 2012:Montana voters have shown in past elections that they will support candidates who do not represent the two major political parties. Just four years ago, Libertarian candidate Dan Cox received 6.5 percent of the vote in Montana's Senate race. Some political analysts speculated his strong showing prevented Republican Denny Rehberg from beating incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat• If he reaches $10 million in direct campaign donations, he runs the risk of being offered Secret Service protection.

Johnson will be appearing in Maine on August 26:""It was like he was saying everything in my brain,"" [Heidi] Sawyer said. ""For me, Johnson represents fiscal conservatism, small government, not wasteful spending, a government where more money would go to classrooms and where they'd make sense."" Sawyer, the creator of the popular Lewiston Rocks Facebook page, was intrigued. ""Things like that perked my interest,"" she said. Sawyer said she's fiscally conservative but socially liberal. She's not opposed to gay marriage. ""I don't care about what people do in their bedrooms,"" she said. The Libertarian Party isn't about foreign involvement, ""fighting wars creating more conflict. I want to make sure we're not putting our nose where it shouldn't be."" So, Sawyer became a Maine state volunteer coordinator for the Libertarian Party...The Maine L.P. needs to have ""10,000 registered voters who are enrolled in the party cast ballots in the General Election, among other provisions in Maine law,"" to maintain ballot status as an official party, according to the state government.I reported earlier on Maine's difficult but ultimately successful fight to get on the ballot this year.","Reframe the text as a policy proposal or white paper, providing solutions to problems discussed.",It also discusses the potential impact of Johnson's candidacy on the upcoming election and the Libertarian Party's situation in the state.**Policy Proposal****Objective:**The purpose of this policy proposal is to address the issues discussed in the text and propose solutions to improve the Libertarian Party's standing and increase its electoral impact.

"THE STING videos targeting Planned Parenthood are hard to watch. Doctors talk clinically, some say callously, about harvesting fetal tissue. Technicians identify and isolate tiny organs. References are made to “it’s a baby” or “it’s another boy.” The videos were taken surreptitiously and were artfully edited to produce maximum discomfort about complicated issues that, for many, are inherently uncomfortable.That truths were distorted to paint an inaccurate and unfair picture of a health organization that provides valuable services to women — as well as to demonize research that leads to important medical advances — doesn’t matter to antiabortion activists. Or, sadly, to the politicians who pander to them.Planned Parenthood is under virulent attack for the role a small portion of its affiliates play in helping women who want to donate fetal tissue for medical research. The antiabortion group Center for Medical Progress has orchestrated a propaganda campaign accusing the nation’s largest provider of abortions of profiting from the illegal sale of fetal tissue, a charge refuted by Planned Parenthood.None of the videos released shows anything illegal and, in fact, the full footage of Planned Parenthood executives meeting with people presumed to be buyers for a human biologics company include repeated assertions that clinics are not selling tissue but only seeking permitted reimbursement costs for expenses. Indeed, the Colorado clinic featured in the videos refused to enter into a contract with the phony company because of its failure to meet its legal and ethical standards.Such facts, though, haven’t stopped officials in several Republican-led states, including Texas, Louisiana and Ohio, from launching investigations of Planned Parenthood, even though affiliates in those states don’t facilitate fetal tissue donations. In Washington, Senate Republicans have fast-tracked a bid to defund Planned Parenthood, with a vote set for Monday. Fortunately, it’s unlikely there will be 60 votes to advance the bill, as cutting off funds to Planned Parenthood would be irresponsible.No federal money is used by Planned Parenthood to provide abortions except in some rare exceptions. So cutting off government funds, mostly through Medicaid and grants, would only hurt the thousands of people, most of them low-income women, who each day depend upon Planned Parenthood for birth control, cancer screenings, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and other health services. Given that many of the clinics are in medically underserved areas, it’s a myth, as Republicans claim, that other providers can fill the gap. Shutting down clinics would make it harder for many women to obtain birth control — and the last thing either side of the abortion debate should want is an increase in unwanted pregnancies that result in more abortions.We are under no illusions that the vendetta against Planned Parenthood will end. Conservative Republicans are already threatening to shut down the federal government in the fall by blocking any spending that includes money for Planned Parenthood. It’s clear from how quickly Republican presidential hopefuls seized on the issue that it will be a staple of the campaign trail. Consequently, it’s important that congressional Democrats and others continue to stand up for Planned Parenthood and the women whose health depends upon its services.","Transform the article into a fantasy tale, with elements of magic or myth intertwined with real events.","In the realm of whispers and ancient magic, where the boundaries of reality danced with myth, there lived a health organization known as Planned Parenthood. It was a beacon of compassion and wisdom, offering a sanctuary to women in need.One fateful day, a sinister force emerged, casting a shadow over the land. Antiabortion activists, fueled by their unwavering belief that life begins at conception, began to spread misinformation and demonize the research that led to important medical advancements. As"
"Former GOP presidential hopeful Linsdey Graham has announced his endorsement of Jeb Bush for president.Graham's presidential campaign went nowhere, but as a senator from the early voting state of South Carolina he hopes to still have some clout.Graham praised Bush's temperament Friday morning, following Thursday night's GOP debate. ""He hasn't tried to get ahead in a contested primary by embracing demagoguery ... he's not running to be commander-in-chief by running people down,"" he said.That was clearly a reference to Donald Trump. Bush returned the admiration, calling Graham a ""patriot.""""He loves this country. You just hear it how he spoke from his heart about what's at stake here. What's at stake is our way of life,"" Bush said.Jeb Bush — still slumping in polls — has been looking for a way to jump-start his campaign, but an endorsement from a former candidate who couldn't break through either probably won't give Bush the upswing he needs.With the Iowa caucuses fewer than three weeks away, he's polling behind Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson both nationally and in Iowa. Bush was unable to stand out from the field once again at Thursday's Republican presidential debate. And Bush's donors are reportedly getting skittish, saying it's only a matter of time before he drops out. Politico reported that several donors said they are now waiting for what one former George W.

"In some gas stations around the country, the price of a gallon of regular has dropped below $1.42. AAA and GasBuddy, two organizations that follow gasoline prices, say that gasoline prices below $2 will not be unusual in most of the United States. As oil prices fall, and refinery capacity stays strong, the price of gas could reach $1 a gallon in some areas, a level last reached in 1999. As a matter of fact, the entire states of Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Caroline have gas prices that average at or below $1.75.Gasoline prices are driven mostly by four factors: oil prices, proximity to refineries, refinery capacity and state taxes and levies. Oil prices have dropped below $33 a barrel and continue to collapse. The recent decision by Saudi Arabia to continue to keep its oil exports high essentially has dissolved the OPEC cartel. The decision also has forced the kingdom to chop its 2016 budget. This ongoing supply glut guarantees oversupply of crude. At the same time, slowing national economies in the largest countries, including China, will lower demand. China now tops the list of oil importers, according to the Financial Times, having moved ahead of the United States.The cost of producing oil from shale deposits, particularly in the United States, is greater in some cases than what it can be sold for. Nonetheless, parts of this industry continue pumping, increasing supply, while others go bankrupt because they cannot survive with crude prices so low.Several states house large refineries or are close to those that do. This is particularly the case near the Gulf of Mexico, including the massive refinery operations south of Houston. Some owned by Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) process several hundreds of thousands of barrels per day. Proximity to refineries is a factor in gasoline prices, if the refineries are running at or near capacity and produce gasoline instead of other petroleum products.Finally, gas taxes in several states are well below the national average of $0.4869 a gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. In some low gas price states, these taxes are below $0.40. This includes South Carolina at $0.3515, Missouri at $0.3570 and Oklahoma at $0.3540. Low gas taxes in these states compound the effect of falling oil prices.The odds grow each day that gas prices will be $1 a gallon in some areas in the United States, particularly those where prices are already close to hitting $1.40 — and falling.24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Barry Morris, spokesman for the Marine Corps Special Operations Command at Camp Lejeune.Like the Army's Green Berets and the Navy's SEALs, these Marines were highly skilled unconventional warriors, trained to endure grueling conditions and sensitive assignments on land and at sea, from seizing ships to special reconnaissance missions and direct action inside hostile territory.The helicopter was part of a nighttime training mission Tuesday at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. There was dense fog in the area at the time of the crash but officials have not said what caused the helicopter to go down.Fog had reduced visibility to less than two miles at the time, according to the National Weather Service. Another helicopter participating in the exercise turned back because of the bad weather before the other Black Hawk crashed, authorities said.Despite the human remains washing ashore, the military still called it a rescue mission Wednesday, said Sara Vidoni, a spokeswoman for Eglin Air Force Base, outside Pensacola.The fog remained so heavy Wednesday that search boats just offshore could be heard but not seen, blasting horns as their crews peered into the choppy water. It finally began to lift in the afternoon, enabling a helicopter to slowly survey the water.About a dozen airmen wearing fatigues walked shoulder-to-shoulder down the beach, scanning the sand, while civilian rescue crews and searchers with dogs joined the effort.The Coast Guard said debris was first spotted about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, and that the search area expanded to a 17-mile stretch of the narrow sound separating Santa Rosa Island from the Florida Panhandle mainland.The Marines were part of a special operations group based in Camp Lejeune. They had arrived Sunday for a week of training.None were immediately identified, so that families could be told first.The helicopter that crashed had joined the training from an airport in nearby Destin.

"The Senate on Tuesday voted to block the controversial legislation cracking down on the so-called ""sanctuary cities"" that shield residents from federal immigration authorities.Following an impassioned speeches by Texas' Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and New Jersey's Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez arguing, respectively, for and against the Sanctuary Cities Bill, the Senate voted 54-46 against the legislation.The bill has divided Congress along partisan lines and gained national attention in the wake of GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump's harsh words on immigration and the shooting death of a California woman over the summer by an undocumented immigrant.""We are witnessing the most overtly nativist and xenophobic campaign in modern U.S. history,"" Menendez said on Tuesday. ""We've hit a new low with the extraordinarily hateful rhetoric that diminishes immigrants' contributions to American history — and particularly demonizes the Latino community by labeling Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals.""The bill, which went up for procedural vote on Tuesday, was authored by Louisiana Sen. David Vitter. It would have punished jurisdictions that prohibit the collection of immigration information or don't cooperate with federal requests, blocking them from receiving certain grants and funds.Republicans have pushed the bill since the July 1 shooting of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco. The man charged in the killing was in the country illegally despite a long criminal record and multiple prior deportations. The man, Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, had been released by San Francisco authorities despite a request from federal immigration authorities to keep him detained.""Today, the Senate had an opportunity to send the message that defiance of our laws will no longer be tolerated,"" Cruz said in a press release after the vote. ""While Senate Democrats chose partisan loyalty over protecting the lives of Americans, I will continue fighting to stop illegal immigration.""  He added: ""Defiance of our immigration laws is inexcusable. Sanctuary cities and the illegal reentry offenders that they harbor are a threat to the safety of the American people. And they must end now.""Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said before the vote that the bill would threaten cities' ability to police and compared it to Republican presidential candidate Trump's comments earlier this year that some immigrants in the country illegally are ""criminals"" and ""rapists.""""This vile legislation might as well be called 'The Donald Trump Act,'"" Reid said.San Francisco and hundreds of other jurisdictions nationally have adopted policies of disregarding federal immigration requests, or ""detainers,"" which advocates say can unfairly target innocent immigrants and hurt relations between immigrant communities and law enforcement authorities.The House passed legislation similar to Vitter's bill this summer, which the White House also threatened to veto. In its veto threat of the Senate legislation, the White House said the bill could lead to mistrust between the federal government and local governments.The Obama administration has said that the best way to get at the problem is comprehensive immigration overhaul, something House Republicans have blocked for years.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter & Instagram","Transform the text into a trivia quiz, testing knowledge on facts or details mentioned in the story.",**Trivia Quiz:**1.

"LAS VEGAS  The Democratic presidential candidates are holding their first debate Tuesday night in Las Vegas.It marks the first time frontrunner Hillary Clinton and her main challenger so far  socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.  will appear on the same stage in this campaign, along with the other three candidates.This campaign was expected to be a cakewalk for the former first lady, but it hasn't turned out that way.One big reason seems to be the story that just won't away: how she used a private email server to conduct government business. It's fed a perception that she can play by a different set of rules.Even so, Clinton still has a decent lead nationally over the socialist senator from Vermont, but Sanders is coming on strong. He's beating her comfortably in the key state of New Hampshire and is close in Iowa, too.Plus, Sanders is the one drawing tens of thousands of people to his events. Democratic voters seem to be listening intently to his populist messages.With the threat from Sanders a reality, Clinton is now trying to reposition herself a little more leftward. Just recently she came out against President Barack Obama's big Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement.That's a reversal because while serving as secretary of state, she was for it. This new position puts her more in line with the liberal base of her party.""As of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it,"" Clinton said. ""I don't believe it's going to meet the high bar I have set.""So, tonight the drama will center on how much Sen. Sanders and the other Democrats confront Clinton directly on the debate stage.Expect former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley to be an instigator.

"Washington (CNN) Donald Trump backed off a false claim Friday morning, admitting he had not seen a video of a $400 million payment being unloaded from a US plane in Iran.The Republican nominee had claimed at rallies twice this week that such a video existed, saying in Maine on Thursday that it was provided by Iranians ""to embarrass our president because we have a president who's incompetent.""What Trump had actually seen in news reports was video of three American prisoners who Iran had released arriving in Geneva, Switzerland.Trump admitted his error in an early-morning tweet Friday, without actually saying he was wrong.""The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!"" he tweeted.The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!It was a rare reversal for Trump, who has stood by inaccurate or unproven claims previously -- insisting he'd seen videos of Muslim Americans in New Jersey cheering the September 11, 2001, attacks. His political rise began during the 2012 campaign, when he insisted that Obama release his birth certificate, questioning the President's American citizenship.Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine hit Trump on Friday for the video claim, saying he seems ""confused"" on CBS' ""This Morning,"" in an interview taped before Trump backtracked.""I have no idea what he's talking about. It (the video) doesn't exist. He might be thinking about Iran Contra from like 35 years ago or something like this,"" Kaine said.He pointed to Trump's recent criticism of Kaine, who Trump said in a late-July news conference ""did a terrible job in New Jersey"" -- despite Kaine being a governor and senator from Virginia, not New Jersey.

The point is, $400 million in cash that most likely ended up in terrorist camps used against the west was given in exchange for hostages and the President of the United States lied to the American people, that's the point.""Trump has made criticism of the US delivery of $400 million in cash via a plane to Iran -- the first installment of $1.7 billion in payments related to a decades-old dispute over an unfulfilled us arms purchase before the Iranian revolution cut relations between the two countries and settled at the same time Iran released four American prisoners -- a staple this week on the campaign trail.But Wednesday in Florida and Thursday in Maine, he went a step further, claiming he'd seen video of the cash actually being delivered in Iran.""It was interesting because a tape was made. Right? You saw that? With the airplane coming in -- nice plane -- and the airplane coming in, and the money coming off, I guess. Right? That was given to us, has to be, by the Iranians,"" Trump said in Portland, Maine.""And you know why the tape was given to us? Because they want to embarrass our country. They want to embarrass our country. And they want to embarrass our president because we have a president who's incompetent. They want to embarrass our president,"" Trump said.

"The movie star created a stir during her Best Supporting Actress Academy Award acceptance speech at Sunday night's Oscars, when she said: ""To every woman who gave birth to every taxpayer and citizen of this nation, we have fought for everybody else's equal rights. It's our time to have wage equality once and for all, and equal rights for women in the United States of America.""The comment was a hit in the moment, with Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lopez effusing their support.Now, likely 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Labor Secretary Tom Perez and other Democrats are using those comments as a way to raise an issue that's been central to their party's economic message in recent years.""I think we all cheered at Patricia Arquette's speech at the Oscars -- because she's right,"" Clinton told an audience of women working in Silicon Valley's technology industry in California on Tuesday.Other Democrats praised Arquette's comments, too.

Thx for using your speech to advocate for #EqualPay and for understanding that when women succeed, America succeeds — Valerie Jarrett (@vj44) February 23, 2015 Democrats have pushed a bill intended to close the pay gap between men and women by offering new legal protections to women who complain that they're being underpaid relative to their male peers, and by having the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission collect gender and racial pay data. The bill failed to clear the 60-vote procedural threshold in the Senate last year -- and it's all but certain not to advance now that Republicans control both the House and the Senate, leaving Democrats to raise the issue on the presidential campaign trail instead. Republicans argue there are already enough protections on the books to ensure women have the right to equal wages. Clinton's comments come as The New York Times reports she plans to make her gender -- and potential to break the ""glass ceiling"" and become America's first female president -- a central theme in her widely expected 2016 campaign. During her speech Tuesday, Clinton recalled being pregnant while working in an Arkansas law firm that had no maternity leave policy.

"Former Florida governor and likely GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush offered a defense of conservative Christian principles and attacked the Obama administration for failing to preserve religious freedom during his commencement address at Liberty University, a Christian school in Lynchburg, Virginia.Bush accused the Obama administration of using ""coercive federal power"" to infringe on the religious rights of Americans.""What should be easy calls, in favor of religious freedom, have instead become an aggressive stance against it. Somebody here is being small-minded and intolerant, and it sure isn’t the nuns, ministers, and laymen and women who ask only to live and practice their faith,"" he said, according to remarks released ahead of the speech. ""Federal authorities are demanding obedience, in complete disregard of religious conscience -- and in a free society, the answer is 'no.'”Last year, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Obama administration could not require closely held corporations to provide insurance coverage of contraception to employees if the employers objected on religious grounds.Bush converted to Catholicism -- his wife's religion -- two decades ago following a tense period in his marriage. Bush has said in the past that he believes the faith of leaders should shape their decision-making.""[S]ome moral standards are universal.

"Donald Trump, the actual Republican candidate for president, now endorsed by his party leaders, openly said he wants to exclude someone from a government job because of his race and ethnicity.As the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, Trump said he wants to disqualify the federal judge overseeing the Trump University case because of his ""Mexican heritage"" and membership in a Latino lawyers association:Mr. Trump said U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel had ""an absolute conflict"" in presiding over the litigation given that he was ""of Mexican heritage"" and a member of a Latino lawyers' association. Mr. Trump said the background of the judge, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrants, was relevant because of his campaign stance against illegal immigration and his pledge to seal the southern U.S. border. ""I'm building a wall. It's an inherent conflict of interest,"" Mr. Trump said.This is pure racism. There's no subtlety, no dog whistle, no coded language.Somehow this isn't too surprising. Trump is, after all, the presidential candidate who launched his campaign by calling Mexican immigrants criminals and ""rapists,"" and he proposed banning all Muslims from entering the US.And with this latest remark, Trump is just turning the thinly veiled subtext into text. He had already previously brought up Curiel's Mexican heritage, suggesting that there was a conflict of interest because of it but not saying it quite so explicitly.Reading this, it's hard for me, a Hispanic American, to avoid feeling a little personally insulted. This suggests that Trump would probably dismiss my opinion — indeed, this article — because of my name. Yet millions of Americans — and a major political party — want him to be president, despite his clear racism.Maybe the media plays a role here. After all, instead of calling it like it is, CBS News, MSNBC, the Washington Post, and the New York Times have called Trump's comments about Curiel ""racially charged"" and ""racially tinged,"" the weasel words the media typically uses to describe racism. It makes one wonder: What would it take for them to finally call Trump or his remarks just plainly racist? If claiming a qualified, vetted judge shouldn't be able to do his job because of his race and ethnicity isn't racist, then what the hell is?Perhaps the problem is Hispanic people are vastly underrepresented in media. As the journalism organization ASNE found, racial minorities make up less than 13 percent of the field — despite making up about 38 percent of the total US population. That might make it harder for a lot of journalists to see just how racist Trump's remarks are.If that's the case, maybe it would be helpful for the predominant white journalists in the field to consider: If President Barack Obama or President Marco Rubio said all white people should be banned from acting as judge in a court case against him, would that be considered racist? And how is that any different from what Trump is doing?There should be no doubt about it now: Donald Trump is racist. He wants to exclude people from government jobs because of their race and ethnicity. That is the literal definition of racism. The media shouldn't shy away from pointing that out, and the people supporting Trump should know that's exactly what they're supporting.",Rewrite the text to simplify complex ideas and summarize key points for a younger audience or readers unfamiliar with the topic.,"He said he wants to disqualify a federal judge named Gonzalo Curiel because of his ""Mexican heritage"" and membership in a Latino lawyers association.Trump said that Curiel had ""an absolute conflict"" in presiding over the litigation because of his heritage and association.

"Raleigh, North Carolina (CNN) As soon as the first debate of the 2016 presidential election was over, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were quick to claim victory.But by the next morning, one of them had become far less cheerful.Just hours after Clinton and Trump clashed on stage at Hofstra University in one of the most highly anticipated political events in modern history, the two presidential nominees took markedly different tones as they reflected on the previous night's debate.Clinton and her aides showed all of the outward signs of a team riding high.The Democratic nominee boarded her plane at Westchester County Airport to applause and cheers from her staff. Before taking off to Raleigh, North Carolina, for a campaign rally, a smiling candidate walked to the back of the plane to gloat to reporters about a ""great, great"" evening""One of my favorite baseball players growing up, Ernie Banks, used to get so excited about going to play that he would say, 'Lets play two,'"" Clinton said. ""So I am looking forward to the next debate and the one after that.""And taking a dig at Trump's complaint after the debate that he was given a ""defective"" microphone, Clinton quipped: ""Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night.""And in fact, the Republican nominee did not appear to be having a good morning.Calling into Fox News' ""Fox & Friends"" early Tuesday, Trump rattled off more than one complaint about the debate.Those compliments were long gone.""I had some hostile questions,"" Trump said on Fox News. ""He didn't ask her about the emails at all. He didn't ask her about her scandals. He didn't ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed. He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. There's no question about it.""Trump was still irritated -- and even conspiratorial -- about his microphone.""My microphone was terrible,"" Trump complained. ""I wonder: was it set up that way on purpose?""To top things off, Trump unloaded on former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who has alleged that the businessman's disparaging treatment of her had led to eating disorders and depression.With no apparent consideration for the political recklessness of his crude comments, Trump once again went after Machado's physical appearance, bringing her up on his own.""That person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst. The absolute worst,"" Trump said. ""She gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem. We had a real problem.""Those remarks could prove to be detrimental for a candidate already struggling with women voters and with the perception that he lacks the temperament to be president.Late Monday, the Clinton campaign released a new video featuring Machado. ""He'd tell me, 'You look ugly,' or, 'You look fat,'"" Machado says in the video. ""Sometimes he'd 'play' with me and say: 'Hello, Miss Piggy,' 'Hello, Miss Housekeeping.'""Machado also held a press call Tuesday afternoon to respond to Trump's comments and express her support for Clinton. She told reporters that watching the 2016 election was like a ""really bad dream.""""I never imagined in 20 years later I will be in this position,"" she said. ""Watching this guy again doing stupid things and stupid comments.""Speaking in Raleigh Tuesday afternoon, Clinton continued to make digs at Trump's debate performance, saying it was ""very clear that he didn't prepare.""""What we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent,"" she said. ""It's unclear exactly what he is saying, but words matter.""Marguerite Scott, a retired 68-year-old woman from Cary, North Carolina, who attended the Raleigh campaign event, said she was struck by Trump appearing to lose his composure during the debate. Scott lso chastised the GOP nominee for his comments Tuesday about Machado.""Men in general should stop objectifying women. If she is fat, that is her business,"" Scott said. ""And to put her on blast like that shows what a misogynist person he is.""",Reframe the text as an open letter to a public figure or organization mentioned in the story.,"Dear Mr. Trump,I am writing to you in response to your recent comments about the debate and the subsequent issues that have arisen.

"Turkey Says It Shot Down A Russian Warplane Near Border With SyriaTurkey says that after issuing 10 warnings in five minutes, two of its F-16s shot down a Russian warplane that Turkey claims violated its airspace.On Twitter, Russia's Defense Ministry said its Sukhoi SU-24 was flying ""only within the borders of Syrian territory."" Its pilots, the Russians said, appear to have ejected.Later in the day, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the action a ""stab in the back by the terrorists' accomplices.""According to The Associated Press, Putin went on to say that there would be ""significant consequences.""""We will never tolerate such atrocities as happened today and we hope that the international community will find the strength to join forces and fight this evil,"" Putin said.The AP published video that appears to show a damaged warplane crash into a hillside. The video, shot from Turkey's Hatay province, then appears to show the pilots parachuting down:The Washington Post reports that Russia initially disputed Turkey's version of events, saying the plane was likely downed ""due to shelling from the ground.""Update at 3 p.m. ET: Body Of One Pilot FoundA spokesman for a Syrian rebel group called the 10th Coastal Brigade told NPR's Alison Meuse that it had the body of one of the Russian pilots and also released a video showing the body. The group said the pilot was dead when it found him. He could have been killed in the shoot-down of his jet, when he came under fire during his parachute descent or in a barrage of fire that the rebels laid down to prevent the pilots from heading to a regime-held area nearby.The spokesman said the group does not know the condition or whereabouts of the second pilot. He may have run to regime-held areas.Update at 3:10 p.m. ET: Rebels Say They Downed CopterAnother Syrian rebel group, the First Coastal Division, tells NPR that it destroyed a Russian helicopter that had landed about 7 km from the area where the Russian jet was downed.The helicopter was shot down by a TOW missile provided by a covert U.S. program to support Syrian rebels, according to the media director for the group, which is part of the Free Syrian Army coalition.The media director did not have information on the Russian crew of the helicopter. The group has released a video purporting to show the attack on the helicopter, showing it engulfed in a huge explosion.NATO officials held an extraordinary meeting to discuss the incident. Afterward, NATO's secretary general Jens Stoltenberg released a statement saying, ""We stand in solidarity with Turkey and support the territorial integrity of our NATO ally, Turkey"":The downing of the warplane figured into today's White House meeting between President Obama and French President Francois Hollande, who is trying to shore up support following the recent attacks in Paris.Obama said Turkey had the right to defend its territory.

"The race for the White House has become even more uncertain as federal investigators begin searching through newly discovered emails belonging to Hillary Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin.The emails were found on a laptop of Abedin's estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, who is currently under investigation for allegedly sexting an underage girl.Officials have obtained a warrant to search those emails, but it is unlikely the review will be completed by Election Day.Meanwhile, the presidential race has tightened dramatically in the last several days.The gap was closing even before Friday's news that the FBI would reopen the investigation into Clinton's emails, but now the contest is virtually a dead heat.Even though the polls are close, Clinton still has an apparent advantage in the Electoral College. Consequently, both candidates are hitting key swing states where the election will likely be decided.Addressing supporters at a rally in Kent, Ohio, Monday, the former secretary of state sounded defiant about the email controversy.""I'm sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of wrongdoing with just days to go? That's a good question,"" Clinton said.""First of all, for those of you who are concerned about my use of personal email, I understand. As I said, I'm not making excuses, I understand and I regret it,"" she continued. ""They should look at them. And I'm sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year.

"Hillary Clinton is firing back at Donald Trump after he announced his new tax plan Monday and promised that the United States would reach amazing new heights under his presidency.The GOP nominee was on his best behavior during his latest campaign stop, managing to stay on topic and never lose his cool despite interruptions by protesters.Speaking at the Detroit Economic Club, Trump laid out his plans for America's economy.""We will make America grow again. I want to jump-start America and it can be done and it won't even be that hard,"" he vowed.Among his ideas were the following proposals:Trump also took some time to slam Clinton's economic plans, saying she punished Americans for working and doing business in the United States.Clinton wasted no time firing back, calling Trump's plans a re-packaging of old Republican ideas.""Today in Detroit he's got, I don't know, a dozen or so economic advisers he just named.

"Obama On Climate Change: 'I Actually Think We're Going To Solve This Thing'""I actually think we're going to solve this thing.""That's what President Obama said in a news conference just before he left a United Nations summit on climate change.""Climate change is a massive problem,"" Obama said. ""It is a generational problem. It's a problem that by definition is just about the hardest thing for a political system to absorb, because the effects are gradual, they're diffused. And yet despite all that ... I'm optimistic. I think we're going to solve it.""Just a few years ago, Obama said, nobody would have predicted that more than 150 leaders would come to Paris holding plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions.""All of this will be hard,"" Obama said. ""Getting 200 nations to agree on anything is hard ... but I'm convinced that we're going to get big things done here.""Obama leaves the conference, but his deputies will remain in Paris in an effort to craft a global, legally binding agreement intended to curb climate change. The big goal: to keep the global temperature from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius.At the moment, if you add up all the commitments on the table at the summit and assume that they would be met, the temperature would still rise by 2.7 degrees, Obama said.""That's too high,"" Obama said. But ""what we expect is that we'll hit these targets faster than expected and ... we could pick up the pace.""Obama said that is not just ""foolish optimism"" but an expectation based on past experience. The United States, for example, was able to meet its goals faster than expected.""The key here is to set up the structure so we're sending signals all around the world that says this is happening and we're not turning around,"" Obama said.Obama touched on a whole host of other issues during the conference. Here are a couple of highlights:— Obama says that the fact that the peace process for Syria is progressing in Vienna is a sign that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""realizes there is not going to be a military solution to the situation in Syria.""Eventually, Obama said, he expects the Russians to shift their focus in Syria from trying to prop up the regime of Bashar Assad to fighting the Islamic State.""I think Mr. Putin understands that for him to get bogged down in an inconclusive and paralyzing civil conflict is not the outcome that he is looking for,"" Obama said.In other words, Obama said, both the U.S. and Russia agree that the only lasting solution in Syria will be political.""Where we continue to have an ongoing difference is not in the need for a political settlement; it's whether Assad can continue to serve as president as that transition goes on,"" Obama said.Russia believes Assad should play a role, and Obama believes that ""it is impossible for Mr. Assad to bring that country together.""— On the shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado, Obama said Congress should act. Just as the country takes huge, costly steps to fight terrorism, it has to take steps to reduce gun homicides.""At the end of the day, Congress, states, local governments are going to have to act in order to make sure that we are preventing people who are deranged or have violent tendencies"" from getting weapons that magnify the damage that they can do, Obama said.Earlier in the day, President Obama urged Turkey and Russia to ease tensions by focusing on a common enemy: the Islamic State.The relationship between the two countries has been frayed since Turkey downed a Russian jet in November. Turkey has refused to apologize, saying the Russian warplane crossed over into Turkish airspace. Russia has implemented a series of sanctions.Reuters reports that Obama said the United States supported Turkey's right to defend its airspace, but he also urged the two countries to ""de-escalate tensions.""""We all have a common enemy.

"Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi has resigned under pressure from Shiite rebels who seized the capital in September and have confined the embattled leader to his home for the past two days.Presidential officials said Hadi resigned after being pressured to make concessions to the rebels, known as Houthis. He had earlier pledged political concessions in return for the rebels withdrawing from his house and the nearby presidential palace, but Houthi fighters remained deployed around both buildings throughout the day.Military officials close to the president, who like the other officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters, said Hadi resigned after the Houthis pressured him to give a televised speech to calm the streets.State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Thursday that the U.S. is assessing and seeking confirmation of the report.""We are seeking a peaceful transition,"" she said.The Yemeni government also submitted its resignation Thursday.Prime Minister Khaled Bahah's resignation came as the U.N. envoy to the Arab world's poorest country met with representatives from the rebels, known as Houthis and other political factions to try to implement a deal reached Wednesday to end the crisis.Under the agreement, the group's militias were to withdraw from the presidential palace and key areas of the capital they have overrun in recent days in return for political concessions.It remains unclear who really controls the country.Twenty-four hours after signing the deal, heavily armed Shiite rebels remained stationed outside Hadi's house and the presidential palace.Bahah's technocratic government was formed in November as part of a United Nations-brokered peace deal after the Houthis overran the capital in September.Bahah, a political independent, posted his resignation on his official Facebook page, saying he had held office in ""very complicated circumstances."" He says he resigned in order to ""avoid being dragged into an abyss of unconstructive policies based on no law.""""We don't want to be a party to what is happening or will happen,"" he added.In an attempt to end the logjam, U.N. Envoy Jamal Benomar arrived to the country and held a meeting with Houthis and other political factions to push for implementation of the deal.In a brief press conference before the meeting, Benomar told reporters that the deal -- in essence an activation of the previous UN-brokered agreement struck in September when Houthis overran the capital -- is ""the only solution for Yemen.""Yemen's emerging power vacuum has raised fears that the country's dangerous Al Qaeda branch, which claimed the recent attack on a French satirical weekly, will only grow more powerful and popular as the nation slides toward fragmentation and the conflict takes on an increasingly sectarian tone. The Shiite Houthis and the Sunni terror group are sworn enemies.While the capital was free of violence, clashes did erupt southeast of Sanaa between Houthi gunmen and local tribesman. Tribal leaders said two tribesmen and four gunmen allied with Houthi rebels were killed in Khawlan-Watadah, 30 miles from Sanaa.The violence appeared to subside by midday, but a serious flare-up in the region lying along the road to Marib province, an oil-rich area in central Yemen and a haven for Al Qaeda fighters, could torpedo peace efforts.

"More than half of these enrollees are new to the program, said Burwell, speaking at an event commemorating the close of the second open enrollment period for subsidized private health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act's exchange marketplaces. The enrollment total surpasses the Department of Health and Human Services' projections, but is lower than what the Congressional Budget Office expected.""Nearly 11.7 million Americans signed up or were re-enrolled through the marketplace as of Feb. 22,"" Burwell said. ""We are finally moving the needle on reducing the number of uninsured.""""We're confident that we will prevail in the court case argued before the Supreme Court last week. The law is clear,"" Burwell said Monday. ""The text and structure of the Affordable Care Act demonstrate that individuals in every state are eligible for tax credits. Those who support this lawsuit believe that the law should be dismantled or repealed, and they are content to roll back the progress that we have achieved.""Among the estimated 7.7 million enrollees from the federal health insurance exchanges, 87 percent received tax credits worth $263 a month on average, Burwell said. More than half the enrollees paid $100 or less a month, including their subsidies. ""These numbers show just how important the tax credits are to millions of Americans and to the insurance markets in those states and throughout the marketplace,"" she said.Federal officials and most state-run exchanges have allowed individuals with applications in process to complete them for about a week following the deadline. In addition, the federally managed exchanges serving more than 30 states, and the majority of the exchanges operated by 13 states and the District of Columbia, re-opened enrollment for people who learn when they file their income taxes that they owe a fine under the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate that most U.S. residents have health coverage.The numbers Burwell announced Monday are 300,000 higher than those reported by the White House last month. Although additional tax season sign-ups are likely to boost the tally, enrollment is expected to decline over the course of the year as consumers obtain health coverage through another source, like a job, or as they give up their policies and become uninsured.""While we know that the numbers will change as the year continues, we are pleased with the results today,"" Burwell said.The number of sign-ups Burwell announced Monday doesn't reflect how many of those enrollees have begun paying for their insurance policies, which is necessary to secure coverage. During the 2014 enrollment campaign, the number of enrollees surpassed 8 million, but fell below 7 million within six months.During the year, people can use the exchanges to buy insurance if they experience a life change, such as having a baby or getting married. Open enrollment for 2016 coverage begins Nov. 1, 2015, and runs through Jan. 31, 2016.The health insurance exchange figures announced Monday don't include new sign-ups for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. Nearly 11 million people have joined those programs since Obamacare enrollment began in October 2013, largely driven by the law's broadening of Medicaid eligibility. To date, 28 states and the District of Columbia have opted into the Medicaid expansion.","Reimagine the article as a speculative fiction story, incorporating futuristic elements or technology.","The second open enrollment period had just concluded, leaving an indelible mark on the nation's healthcare system.The enrollment numbers exceeded the Department of Health and Human Services' projections but fell short of the Congressional Budget Office's expectations.

"St. Louis County Police announced on Sunday that they had made an arrest related to the two officers who were shot during a protest on Thursday in Ferguson, Missouri.St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch announced that authorities had brought charges, including assault in the first degree, against 20-year-old Jeffrey Williams. Williams is from the St. Louis area and had been on probation for receiving stolen property.Williams had been involved in protests on the evening that the shooting occurred and had ""acknowledged"" firing shots, according to McCulloch. McCulloch said that Williams, who is African-American, may have been firing at someone other than the police.""We don't know him,"" said Tony Rice, the founder of Ground Level Support, who has been protesting since AugustAfter naming three young male protesters who were regularly at the demonstrations, Rice told HuffPost, ""I don't think there is a male 20-years-old that regularly protest outside of them.""""I think I can speak for the protester community in saying we don't know him,"" said Rice.After the press conference, press swarmed Alicia Street when she helped source the first picture of Williams.

I cannot recall that I even seen him that night. We know a lot of people out there, we really do. I even showed pictures to other regular protesters and they said they didn't know him,"" Street told HuffPost.The shooting came during protests after Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson announced that he would resign. One of the officers was shot in the face and the other was shot in the shoulder, but both survived the attack.Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement on Sunday that the arrest was a testament to good collaboration between federal and local authorities.“This arrest sends a clear message that acts of violence against our law enforcement personnel will never be tolerated. The swiftness of this action is a credit to the significant cooperation between federal authorities and the St. Louis County Police Department,"" Holder said.

"The family of Michael Brown will file a civil lawsuit against the city of Ferguson, Missouri, and former Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, an attorney for the family announced Thursday.The news comes just one day after the U.S. Department of Justice officially announced its decision not to file federal charges against Wilson for fatally shooting Brown last July.In a press conference, family attorney Anthony Gray expressed the family’s disappointment in the Justice Department’s decision and announced the next legal actions they plan to take.“We are officially formulating a civil case that we anticipate will be filed very shortly on behalf of the family,” Gray said. “We plan to demonstrate in a court of law that Wilson’s choice to use deadly force was unreasonable and unnecessary.”Brown's parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr., attended the conference but did not make any comments. However, their frustration with the department's decision is widely shared by many local officials, residents and protesters -- some of whom took to the streets Wednesday evening to demonstrate their outrage.The criticism was further fueled by a scathing report released by the Justice Department, also on Wednesday. The report revealed that the city of Ferguson had engaged in unconstitutional patrolling practices that routinely discriminated against African-Americans. It also disclosed emails proving racial bias on behalf of Ferguson police officials.""[It] really just confirms what many of us already knew and what has been experienced by many African-Americans here in the St. Louis region for quite some time,"" St. Louis Alderman Antonio French told HuffPost Live on Wednesday, referring to the report.""Some of the specific details were shocking, [but] there's a culture that's been allowed to fester in Ferguson and one that's really been experienced by African-Americans for years and boiled over last year,"" French continued.Attorneys for the Brown family say they hope some level of accountability can be reached through the civil case. Meanwhile, French has taken the lead in calling for the resignation of the chief of the Ferguson Police Department.“I think some of the specific details outlined in this Department of Justice report really make it impossible for him to stay there,” he said. “When you have the culture that exists with these racist emails ... the stats alone suggest he needs to go.""","Compose the article as a time capsule entry, capturing the current state or events for future generations.",The recent developments in the case have reignited calls for justice and accountability.The family of Michael Brown has announced their intention to file a civil lawsuit against the city of Ferguson and former officer Darren Wilson.

"Really the only unusual or exciting thing about this jobs report is how unusual it is for something so thoroughly expected and non-game-changing to happen. Adding a bit over 200,000 jobs a month is both what analysts thought would happen, and also a trajectory that is consistent with a continued slow decline in unemployment but no real labor market boom.Dive deeper into the data, and the basic lack of surprises only continues. Labor force participation is up, but only very slightly. Hourly wages are up, but only very slightly.There's nothing about this jobs report that is likely to change the Federal Reserve's mind about anything, and therefore no reason to expect financial markets to have any particular reaction. Those who think the Fed's current course is dangerously inflationary will keep thinking that. Those who (more correctly!) think the Fed's current course is unreasonably inflation-averse will keep thinking that, as well. Janet Yellen will keep thinking she's on the right track.Wage growth appears to have settled into a steady pattern that is somewhat better than what we saw at the depths of the recession, but far below what was considered normal before the recession. Partially offsetting this, overall consumer price inflation has been abnormally low for a couple of years now. There are also some compositional effects pulling average wages down as a large cohort of inexperienced 20-somethings have been entering the workforce.Overall it is a little difficult to understand why some of the small upward bumps have been interpreted in some quarters as a sign of an imminent inflationary breakout. Even the strongest wage-growth months have been weak compared with 2006 or 2007, years that were not exactly halcyon days for the American worker.Perhaps the clearest sign of how not-yet-completed America's recovery comes from looking at the level of full-time jobs, which is still well below where it was in 2007:The population, needless to say, has grown in the intervening years, meaning that the failure to fully catch up in job growth makes it difficult for rank-and-file workers to gain bargaining leverage.","Rewrite the article from an alternative perspective, such as from the viewpoint of a person mentioned in the story or from a neutral observer's perspective.","The jobs report was met with a yawn and a shrug by most economists. While the addition of 200,000 jobs a month is certainly welcome, it's hardly the game-changer that some are making it out to be. The data is simply too predictable and lacks the punch to move the needle in either direction.The labor force participation rate is up slightly, but it's still far from the pre-recession peak. Wages"

"Boston magazine has a long take on William Weld, former Massachusetts governor, currently Libertarian vice presidential candidate.The main takeaway, after some of the usual slightly sneery scene-setting about weirdo libertarians (reported from July's FreedomFest in Las Vegas) and the lovely color detail of the patrician Weld being amazed he's staying in a New York hotel whose price is three digits beginning with ""one""?That while Weld totally thinks of himself as libertarian and has for a long time, he's also a guy who just likes to do strange and challenging things as a lark, like writing novels, and hates being bored and likes being in the political mix.An unnamed former adviser says ""There's nothing more he would like than to be flying around the country on somebody else's dime, flying first class, and talking to political reporters all day."" Another unnamed former staffer says of Weld ""He is old money, white, and fucking brilliant...Everybody tries to distance himself from those traits when running for office, and he always embraced them and made them his own.""Reason has written quite a bit on some conflicts between Weld and libertarianism as most define it, despite Weld's long-time affection for that self-identification, and this profile is decent on explaining that aspect of the Weld/Libertarian story.The profile by Simon van Zuylen-Wood sums up that conflict:Weld's strategy isn't to try to defend libertarian ideas. Instead he articulates the ones he thinks disaffected centrists want to hear.

When asked about gun control, Weld suggests the formation—cue a million Libertarians choking on their dinner—of a massive new FBI task force.... .... I ask him, at random, about climate change. He advocates pragmatic, mainstream, and essentially unlibertarian ideas about the urgent need for governing bodies to prevent the rise of global temperatures by 2 degrees Celsius.

"In some gas stations around the country, the price of a gallon of regular has dropped below $1.42. AAA and GasBuddy, two organizations that follow gasoline prices, say that gasoline prices below $2 will not be unusual in most of the United States. As oil prices fall, and refinery capacity stays strong, the price of gas could reach $1 a gallon in some areas, a level last reached in 1999. As a matter of fact, the entire states of Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Caroline have gas prices that average at or below $1.75.Gasoline prices are driven mostly by four factors: oil prices, proximity to refineries, refinery capacity and state taxes and levies. Oil prices have dropped below $33 a barrel and continue to collapse. The recent decision by Saudi Arabia to continue to keep its oil exports high essentially has dissolved the OPEC cartel. The decision also has forced the kingdom to chop its 2016 budget. This ongoing supply glut guarantees oversupply of crude. At the same time, slowing national economies in the largest countries, including China, will lower demand. China now tops the list of oil importers, according to the Financial Times, having moved ahead of the United States.The cost of producing oil from shale deposits, particularly in the United States, is greater in some cases than what it can be sold for. Nonetheless, parts of this industry continue pumping, increasing supply, while others go bankrupt because they cannot survive with crude prices so low.Several states house large refineries or are close to those that do. This is particularly the case near the Gulf of Mexico, including the massive refinery operations south of Houston. Some owned by Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) process several hundreds of thousands of barrels per day. Proximity to refineries is a factor in gasoline prices, if the refineries are running at or near capacity and produce gasoline instead of other petroleum products.Finally, gas taxes in several states are well below the national average of $0.4869 a gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. In some low gas price states, these taxes are below $0.40. This includes South Carolina at $0.3515, Missouri at $0.3570 and Oklahoma at $0.3540. Low gas taxes in these states compound the effect of falling oil prices.The odds grow each day that gas prices will be $1 a gallon in some areas in the United States, particularly those where prices are already close to hitting $1.40 — and falling.24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

"WASHINGTON, June 21 (Reuters) - Tensions are building inside and outside the white marble facade of the U.S. Supreme Court building as the nine justices prepare to issue major rulings on gay marriage and President Barack Obama's healthcare law by the end of the month.Of the 11 cases left to decide, the biggest are a challenge by gay couples to state laws banning same-sex marriage and a conservative challenge to subsidies provided under the Obamacare law to help low- and middle-income people buy health insurance that could lead to millions of people losing medical coverage.Many legal experts predict the court will legalize gay marriage nationwide by finding that the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of equal treatment under the law and due process prohibit states from banning same-sex nuptials.In three key decisions since 1996, Kennedy has broadened the court's view of equality for gays. The most recent was a 2013 case in which the court struck down a federal law denying benefits to married same-sex couples.During oral arguments in the gay marriage case on April 28, Kennedy posed tough questions to lawyers from both sides but stressed the nobility and dignity of same-sex couples.The healthcare decision is tougher to call. Chief Justice John Roberts, the swing vote when the court upheld Obamacare in 2012, said little during the March 4 oral argument to indicate how he will vote.The court will issue some rulings on Monday, with more likely later in the week.For the justices, the pressure is on to have the rulings ready. That can be difficult as the cases in which they are closely divided are generally the ones left until the end.James Obergefell, one of the plaintiffs in the gay marriage case, said he will be at the court for all the remaining decision days.Obergefell sued Ohio, challenging its ban on same-sex marriages, after the state refused to acknowledge his marriage to John Arthur on Arthur's death certificate. They were married in Maryland, a state that allows gay marriages, just months before Arthur died in 2013.The Supreme Court does not announce in advance which rulings will be issued on any given day.""It's nerve-racking, it's exciting, but it's also scary,"" Obergefell said while waiting in line to enter the courtroom on Thursday.On the other side of the issue, the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian group that opposes gay marriage, will have at least two attorneys in the courtroom, spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.As for the closed-door deliberations at the court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg hinted during a June 12 speech at the turmoil to come. ""Sharp divisions, one can confidently predict, will rise in the term's final weeks,"" Ginsburg said.Prior to June 15, the court was split 5-4 in only seven of the 46 cases decided at that point. But last week alone, four of the nine rulings were 5-4 decisions. In the rulings, several justices wrote separate opinions in which they aimed pointed comments at their colleagues.","Convert the article into a lesson plan, outlining educational activities based on the content.",****Lesson Plan****Subject:** U.S. Supreme Court Cases on Gay Marriage and Healthcare Law**Grade Level:** 9-12**Time:** 45 minutes**Learning Objectives:*** Students will be able to summarize the key points of the article.* Students will be able to explain the potential impact of the upcoming rulings.* Students will be able to discuss the challenges facing the justices in issuing these rulings.
"Former Florida governor and likely GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush offered a defense of conservative Christian principles and attacked the Obama administration for failing to preserve religious freedom during his commencement address at Liberty University, a Christian school in Lynchburg, Virginia.Bush accused the Obama administration of using ""coercive federal power"" to infringe on the religious rights of Americans.""What should be easy calls, in favor of religious freedom, have instead become an aggressive stance against it. Somebody here is being small-minded and intolerant, and it sure isn’t the nuns, ministers, and laymen and women who ask only to live and practice their faith,"" he said, according to remarks released ahead of the speech.

""He said it was because he was a Christian and because God is in the mix.""Obama's views on the subject have since evolved, and he said in 2012 that he supports same-sex marriage.Republicans, particularly younger ones, have also been warming to the idea of gay marriage. But Huckabee said his views won't change ""unless I get a new version of the Scriptures.""""This is not just a political issue, it's a biblical issue,"" he said.

"Wenjian Liu, 32, and his partner, Rafael Ramos, 40, were murdered on Dec. 20 as they sat in their squad car in Brooklyn after killer Ismaaiyl Brinsley had stated he was seeking vengeance for the deaths this summer of two unarmed black men at the hands of white police officers.Brinsley killed himself after ambushing the officers.With de Blasio expected to speak at Liu's funeral, police commissioner Bill Bratton told officers ahead of Saturday's wake to refrain from the ""act of disrespect"" seen at Ramos' funeral a week ago, when thousands of officers turned their backs on the mayor.""A hero's funeral is about grieving, not grievance,"" Bratton wrote in a memo to officers.De Blasio and Bratton entered the funeral home together for the wake as officers stood guard by the entrance, saluting both men as they went in.The murders frayed already strained relations between the police force and de Blasio, who sharply criticized the NYPD's ""stop-and-frisk"" tactics during his 2013 campaign.The liberal mayor also offered qualified support for the wave of protests triggered by the two black men's deaths in New York and Ferguson, Missouri, and has said he talked to his bi-racial son, Dante, about interacting with police.Immediately after Liu and Ramos were shot, Patrick Lynch, the head of the city's largest police union, expressed scorn for de Blasio, saying there was ""blood on many hands.""Ramos' funeral a week ago among the largest in NYPD history, with more than 20,000 officers from around the country on hand.When de Blasio began his eulogy there, many uniformed officers turned their backs in a gesture of disdain, which Bratton called inappropriate, saying it had stolen the ""valor, honor and attention"" that was rightfully due the slain officer.In his memo, Bratton said he understood emotions were running high among the rank and file, adding that his entreaty to the department was not a mandate and he was not threatening to discipline those who did not comply.""But,"" he said, ""I remind you that when you don the uniform of this department, you are bound by the tradition, honor and decency that go with it.""","Incorporate historical context into the article, comparing and contrasting the events or information with similar historical events or trends.","The events that unfolded on that fateful day have sparked a renewed conversation about the strained relationship between the New York Police Department (NYPD) and Mayor Bill de Blasio.The murders were committed by Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who stated his intent to seek revenge for the deaths of two unarmed black men at the hands of white police officers"

"After his shotgun wedding to the presumptive GOP nominee last week, the House speaker is getting a glimpse of his future with a man who puts his dreams before anyone else’s.There’s no currently available evidence showing that Donald Trump’s entire campaign is just one big, deliberate effort to troll Paul Ryan.Since Ryan allied himself with the mogul, Trump has engaged in some of his worst behavior of the cycle, and his backers show no restraint in their eagerness to malign and mock the Speaker of the House. Any hoped-for Trump/Ryan Era of Good Feelings?On June 2, Ryan endorsed Trump. He said he made that decision because he believes a President Trump will help pass his forthcoming agenda.“Through these conversations, I feel confident he would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people’s lives,” Ryan said. “That’s why I’ll be voting for him this fall.”One day later, Donald Trump welcomed Paul Ryan to the rest of his life by saying the federal judge overseeing a civil case against the now-defunct Trump University is unsuited for the job because he’s of Mexican ancestry (said judge, Gonzalo Curiel, was born in Indiana).Ryan responded to the comments in a press conference he held in Southeast D.C. to roll out the first item on his policy agenda, a series of proposals to fight poverty.The focus of the morning could have been on the fact that House Republicans finally decided to start talking about poverty—an issue their party has long declined to focus on. But the biggest news Paul Ryan made was his response to Trump.“Saying a person can’t do their job because of their race is sort of the textbook definition of racist comments,” he said, saying Trump’s comments on Curiel “should be absolutely disavowed.”“I’m not going to even pretend to defend them,” he added. “I’m going to defend our ideas. I’m going to defend our agenda. What matters to us most is our principles and the policies that come from those principles, and our ability to give the people of this country a better way forward.”Tuesday’s press conference, was suppose to highlight Ryan’s latest attempt to turn the page away from the insanity of the presidential election and back to the serious business of lawmaking. He has spent the past few weeks cutting campaign-style videos teasing the release of a series of proposals from House Republicans.The sad irony of all this is that Trump actually paid lip service to Ryan’s anti-poverty plan when he appeared on CBS’s Face the Nation on June 5.“Paul Ryan—well, I think we will agree on—as an example, he really focuses on poverty,” Trump told host John Dickerson. “He wants to take people out of poverty. So do I. And we’re going to come up with a plan.”But that comment was totally drowned out by the criticism Trump drew for saying on the same show that a Muslim judge would probably be just as unfair to him as a judge of Mexican ancestry.","Reframe the article as a motivational speech, inspiring action or change based on the content.","The House Speaker, Paul Ryan, has a glimpse of his future with a man who puts his dreams before anyone else's.

"The Obama administration has made ""virtually no progress"" to increase transparency and accountability for its lethal drone program, a new report has concluded, with only months left to spare before the White House hands control of the targeted killing apparatus to a successor.The report by the nonpartisan Stimson Center said the administration is failing to release fundamental information about the program or to significantly overhaul it — even after a 2015 strike mistakenly left American contractor Warren Weinstein and Italian hostage Giovanni Lo Porto dead.""We have seen relatively few successes,"" said Rachel Stohl, a researcher at the center. ""The administration has been unwilling to provide the number of strikes, even in aggregate; the number of civilian casualties that they estimate that have occurred because of those strikes; the legal justification, unless required by court order, that allows the program to continue; so even on the most basic levels, what is the program doing, we don't know.""A bipartisan task force called on the White House nearly two years ago to reconsider its reliance on targeted killing of suspected terrorists, in part, because the strikes may be doing more harm than good by fomenting hatred overseas. But Stimson researchers said they've uncovered little evidence anything like that reorientation has happened.A senior administration official told NPR the White House goes to ""extraordinary lengths"" to avoid civilian casualties.The official added: ""Unlike our enemies, which deliberately and pointedly violate the law of armed conflict, the United States takes great care to adhere to the fundamental law of armed conflict principle of distinction, which requires that attacks be directed only against military objectives and that civilians and civilian objects not be the target of attack.""At least nine nations now have weaponized drones, and four have used them, the report said. ""It's important that the United States establishes good policy and sets an international precedent that demonstrates leadership and responsibility and transparency over the program because other countries are going to follow the U.S. lead,"" Stohl said.U.S. government officials have walked a fine line on the drone program, which is supposed to be secret. Former CIA and NSA Director Michael Hayden addressed the strikes in his new book and an opinion article in the New York Times Sunday, when he wrote: ""I think it fair to say that the targeted killing program has been the most precise and effective application of firepower in the history of armed conflict.""Days earlier, lawyers for the Obama administration appeared in an appeals court in Washington, D.C., to fight a demand by the American Civil Liberties Union for legal justifications and ""summary strike data,"" including the numbers and identities of people killed by weaponized drones.Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the ACLU, said the administration can't have it both ways.""The law of the drone campaign should not be a secret, nor should the CIA be permitted to withhold basic information that would allow the public to understand the implications of the government's policies,"" Jaffer said. ""This is particularly the case since so many senior officials have spoken so freely about drone strikes.""","Compose the article as a bookmark, with a brief summary or quote that captures the story's essence.","The Obama administration's drone program has made ""virtually no progress"" in increasing transparency and accountability, a new report has concluded.

"He's combative. He rejects compromise as ""the mushy middle."" He's not inclined to wait his turn. And he doesn't seem to mind annoying his Republican elders with tactics that critics see as destructive and short-sighted.So perhaps it's no surprise that little more than two years after he was sworn in to the Senate, the 44-year-old Texan on Monday became the first contender to officially announce his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. He skipped the one-step-at-a-time tradition of announcing an ""exploratory"" committee to declare flatly that he was in the race.""It's going to take a new generation of courageous conservatives to help make America great again,"" Cruz said in a 30-second video he posted on Twitter early Monday morning, followed by a speech at Liberty University, ""and I'm ready to stand with you to lead the fight.""He won't be lonely for long. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is slated to announce his candidacy in two weeks, likely followed in short order by yet another Republican senator, Marco Rubio of Florida. That's not to mention the governors (Wisconsin's Scott Walker, New Jersey's Chris Christie, Louisiana's Bobby Jindal), the former governors (Florida's Jeb Bush, Texas' Rick Perry, Arkansas' Mike Huckabee), the former senators (Pennsylvania's Rick Santorum) and the others who already are visiting Iowa and New Hampshire and hiring staffers for nascent campaigns.At his speech, a handful of students in a prominent front row sported red ""Stand With Rand"" sweatshirts.Cruz has been overshadowed in recent months by Bush, Walker and other contenders who have more muscular fundraising networks and stronger institutional support. In the Senate, he has been more of an agitator than a legislator. Arizona Sen. John McCain, the GOP's 2008 nominee, once called him a ""wacko bird.""That said, Cruz is worth watching.For one thing, the skills he honed as a college debater at Princeton — he was named U.S. National Speaker of the Year in 1992 — should serve him well in the series of crowded primary debates.For another, while his Tea Party credentials might be a mixed blessing in a general election, in the primaries they align him with the most energized forces in the Republican grass roots today. That helped him upset the establishment's favorite, lieutenant governor David Dewhurst, for the Republican Senate nomination in 2012.What's more, the locale Cruz chose to make Monday's announcement reflects his efforts to broaden his electoral base by wooing Christian conservatives, another key group in the GOP coalition. He spoke at the Lynchburg, Va., school founded by evangelical leader Jerry Falwell that describes itself on its website as the largest Christian university in the world.His speech had the ring of the religious testimony of an evangelical church. He declared his opposition to abortion and his support of traditional marriage. He emotionally described how his father's embrace of Jesus saved his parents' marriage. His father, Rafael, a pastor at a suburban Dallas church, fled Castro's Cuba in 1957.Cruz's Cuban-American heritage would be a selling point for the Republican Party as it tries to reach out to Hispanic voters, although his hardline stance on immigration could be a complication with those voters. And speaking of biography, he has an education that might surprise those inclined to dismiss him: He was graduated from Princeton and then from Harvard Law School, magna cum laude, before clerking at the Supreme Court for Chief Justice William Rehnquist.At one point, he urged his audience to ""take out your cellphones"" and text the word ""Constitution"" or ""Liberty"" — ""we're flexible,"" he said — to a number linked to his campaign.","Compose the article as a recipe, metaphorically cooking up solutions or ideas mentioned.",It is a metaphorically cooked up solution to the problem of writing a concise and informative summary of the text in a way that is clear and easy to read.**Ingredients:*** Text to be summarized* Culinary metaphors* Clear and concise language* Organization into a logical structure* Use of vivid imagery**Instructions:**1. **Read the text

"Why Negotiators At Paris Climate Talks Are Tossing The Kyoto ModelNegotiators and heads of state from nearly 200 countries are meeting for the next two weeks near Paris to craft a new treaty to slow global warming.It's the 21st ""Conference of the Parties"" held by the United Nations to tackle climate change. One treaty emerged, in 1997, after the conference in Kyoto, Japan. That's no longer in effect, and, in fact, the Kyoto Protocol, as it's known, didn't slow down the gradual warming of the planet.Now governments are ever more desperate to do something to slow warming — so much so that they've thrown out the model set in Kyoto and opted for a new approach for Paris.Valli Moosa, a former climate negotiator from South Africa, says the main reason Kyoto failed to slow warming lies largely with who wasn't included in the treaty. ""You actually cannot have a meaningful agreement without China and the United States being part of it,"" he says.The U.S. Senate refused to ratify the Kyoto treaty, so the world's biggest greenhouse-gas emitter didn't have skin in the game. And developing countries, including China and India, were not required to reduce emissions. Now those countries are becoming the biggest sources of greenhouse gases as their economies thrive. China, in fact, is now the world's biggest emitter, and India isn't far behind. Moreover, the Kyoto treaty had U.N. bureaucrats and negotiators setting goals for the participating countries to lower their greenhouse gases. Many countries didn't make their targets; others dropped out. Economies were at stake, and few countries were comfortable marching to a U.N. beat.So what negotiators are bringing to the table at the Paris talks is an arrangement whereby each country is offering to reduce its own emissions by whatever amount it can manage. And everybody participates, not just developed countries.Most nations arrive with a reduction target already in hand. What will be difficult is deciding who will pay how much to developing countries to build economies that won't keep producing high emissions.French negotiator Laurence Tubiana points out that the key to success is convincing governments that those economies can be ""low-carbon,"" and that this won't be a bar to developing wealth. ""How much I'm sacrificing for the sake of emissions reductions, that's no more,"" she says of the message that negotiators are pushing. ""And now ... the Chinese, even the Indians are really coming in. It's about low-carbon economy.""Previous attempts to replace the Kyoto treaty have failed. This new approach is voluntary, and most of the world has agreed theoretically to participate, which negotiators hope will sweeten things enough to get a deal. Still to be determined, however, is who will pay for this massive revolution in the world's energy economy, and what strings will be attached to their largesse.","Outline as a debate club brief, with points for and against the main argument.","**Points for:*** The Kyoto Protocol failed to slow global warming due to the exclusion of major emitters like China and the U.S., and the lack of enforcement mechanisms.* The new approach at Paris aims for universal participation and sets individual reduction targets for each country.* The key to success is convincing governments that low-carbon economies"

"PARIS, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Police arrested a dozen people suspected of helping the Islamist militant gunmen in last week's Paris killings, the city prosecutor's office said on Friday as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived for talks.The arrests came after Belgian police killed two men who fired on them during one of about a dozen raids on Thursday against an Islamist group and German police said they had arrested two people following a raid on 11 properties linked to radical Salafists.Centered on southern Paris suburbs including the Montrouge area where a young policewoman was killed in the attacks, the arrests were for suspected ""logistical support"" for the shootings, an official said.Seventeen victims and the three attackers died in three days of violence in Paris last week that began with an assault on the offices of satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo.Paris's Gare de l'Est train station was evacuated at 8:00 a.m. local time (0700 GMT) after an alert but reopened about an hour later, the SNCF state railway said, without giving further details.Kerry had said on Thursday that his visit to France was to give a ""big hug"" to Paris. Senior U.S. officials were absent from a commemoration march held in Paris on Sunday attended by dozens of world leaders. President Barack Obama's administration conceded that was an omission.""I think you know that you have the full and heartfelt condolences of the American people and I know you know that we share the pain and the horror of everything that you went through,"" Kerry told Hollande on Friday.""Together we need to find the right responses and this is the purpose of our meeting here today, beyond the friendship,"" he said.Investigators are still poring over the complex chain of events that led to three French nationals - two brothers with Algerian roots and a third of African extraction - perpetrating the worst attacks on French soil for decades.Belgian investigators said they are trying to establish if a man detained in the city of Charleroi on suspicion of arms trafficking had any links with Amedy Coulibaly, the gunman who killed four Jews at a kosher supermarket in Paris last week.His lawyer Michel Bouchat told French media the man was not an associate of Coulibaly and had merely sold him a car. The man in question already contacted police on Tuesday to say he had had contacts with Hayat Boumedienne, the partner of Coulibaly now believed to be in Syria.

"Ousted Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi, along with more than 100 other defendants, was sentenced to death by an Egyptian court Saturday for his role in a mass prison break in 2011.Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected president, is already serving a 20-year jail sentence in jail for ordering the arrest and torture of protesters while president.The then-leader of the Muslim Brotherhood movement was elected president in 2012 after the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak.The Egyptian military deposed Morsi in 2013 following a series of street protests against his rule. In May 2014, Morsi's successor, former military chief Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, who led the coup, won a landslide victory in presidential elections.The Muslim Brotherhood was banned and its supporters rounded up by the thousands.As with all capital punishment cases, the sentence will be sent to the Grand Mufti, Egypt's highest authority, for his opinion.

"That was President Barack Obama's message to American consumers on Tuesday as he discussed near six year-low gas prices in an interview with The Detroit News ahead of a visit to Michigan on Wednesday to tout the recovery of the auto industry and the growth of American manufacturing.""I would strongly advise American consumers to continue to think about how you save money at the pump because it is good for the environment, it's good for family pocketbooks and if you go back to old habits and suddenly gas is back at $3.50, you are going to not be real happy,"" Obama said.But instead of returning to ""old habits,"" Obama advised Americans to save their money, ""or better yet"" use the savings to buy a new car, for example.He said Americans should ""not believe that"" gas prices won't rise again, explaining that demand for oil in booming countries like China and India will continue to rise, kicking costs back up. Oil prices have dropped more than 50% in recent months, falling below $50 a barrel for the first time since 2009 on Monday. Many members of Congress are counting on gas prices to remain low, however, as they hope to use the low prices as an opportunity to increase the gas tax for the first time in more than two decades. As he touts the results of his bailout of the auto industry on Wednesday, Obama will also promote fuel efficiency at the Ford plant he is set to visit, which produces alternative fuel vehicles and small cars, The News reported. Obama gave the newspaper a preview of his speech Wednesday, in which he is expected to tout the resurgence of the auto industry and the boom of American manufacturing -- two key points of his plan for economic recovery, and elements he hopes will become a part of his legacy as president. ""The auto industry has led a resurgence of manufacturing in America,"" Obama said. ""The quality of the cars has gotten so much better that we are competitive — not just in SUVs — but up and down the line. The branding of American cars is back to where it should be. Michigan's unemployment rate has fallen faster than the overall employment rate.""","Reframe the article as a manifesto, outlining a revolutionary vision or call to action based on the content.","**Manifesto for a Revolution in Energy Consumption and Economic Growth**In the face of burgeoning oil prices and the promise of a burgeoning auto industry, we call upon American consumers to embrace a revolutionary vision that will not only safeguard their wallets but also pave the way for a greener future.The current low gas prices offer an opportunity for us to break free from the shackles of our old habits and forge a new path forward.

"He's combative. He rejects compromise as ""the mushy middle."" He's not inclined to wait his turn. And he doesn't seem to mind annoying his Republican elders with tactics that critics see as destructive and short-sighted.So perhaps it's no surprise that little more than two years after he was sworn in to the Senate, the 44-year-old Texan on Monday became the first contender to officially announce his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. He skipped the one-step-at-a-time tradition of announcing an ""exploratory"" committee to declare flatly that he was in the race.""It's going to take a new generation of courageous conservatives to help make America great again,"" Cruz said in a 30-second video he posted on Twitter early Monday morning, followed by a speech at Liberty University, ""and I'm ready to stand with you to lead the fight.""He won't be lonely for long. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is slated to announce his candidacy in two weeks, likely followed in short order by yet another Republican senator, Marco Rubio of Florida. That's not to mention the governors (Wisconsin's Scott Walker, New Jersey's Chris Christie, Louisiana's Bobby Jindal), the former governors (Florida's Jeb Bush, Texas' Rick Perry, Arkansas' Mike Huckabee), the former senators (Pennsylvania's Rick Santorum) and the others who already are visiting Iowa and New Hampshire and hiring staffers for nascent campaigns.At his speech, a handful of students in a prominent front row sported red ""Stand With Rand"" sweatshirts.Cruz has been overshadowed in recent months by Bush, Walker and other contenders who have more muscular fundraising networks and stronger institutional support. In the Senate, he has been more of an agitator than a legislator. Arizona Sen. John McCain, the GOP's 2008 nominee, once called him a ""wacko bird.""That said, Cruz is worth watching.For one thing, the skills he honed as a college debater at Princeton — he was named U.S. National Speaker of the Year in 1992 — should serve him well in the series of crowded primary debates.For another, while his Tea Party credentials might be a mixed blessing in a general election, in the primaries they align him with the most energized forces in the Republican grass roots today. That helped him upset the establishment's favorite, lieutenant governor David Dewhurst, for the Republican Senate nomination in 2012.What's more, the locale Cruz chose to make Monday's announcement reflects his efforts to broaden his electoral base by wooing Christian conservatives, another key group in the GOP coalition. He spoke at the Lynchburg, Va., school founded by evangelical leader Jerry Falwell that describes itself on its website as the largest Christian university in the world.His speech had the ring of the religious testimony of an evangelical church. He declared his opposition to abortion and his support of traditional marriage. He emotionally described how his father's embrace of Jesus saved his parents' marriage. His father, Rafael, a pastor at a suburban Dallas church, fled Castro's Cuba in 1957.Cruz's Cuban-American heritage would be a selling point for the Republican Party as it tries to reach out to Hispanic voters, although his hardline stance on immigration could be a complication with those voters. And speaking of biography, he has an education that might surprise those inclined to dismiss him: He was graduated from Princeton and then from Harvard Law School, magna cum laude, before clerking at the Supreme Court for Chief Justice William Rehnquist.At one point, he urged his audience to ""take out your cellphones"" and text the word ""Constitution"" or ""Liberty"" — ""we're flexible,"" he said — to a number linked to his campaign.","Outline as a debate club brief, with points for and against the main argument.",**Points for:*** **Strong debate skills:** Cruz's experience as a college debater could serve him well in the crowded primary debates.* **Alignment with Tea Party:** Cruz's Tea Party credentials align him with the most energized forces in the Republican grass roots.* **Broadening electoral base:** Cruz's choice of location
"The jury in the Jodi Arias case tasked with deciding whether she should be sentenced to life in prison or death for killing her lover nearly seven years ago was unable to agree on terms of sentencing Thursday, removing the possibility of a death sentence.The judge declared a mistrial and will sentence Arias to either life in prison or a life term with the possibility of release after 25 years.It marked the second time a jury has deadlocked on her punishment -- a disappointment for prosecutors who argued for the death penalty during the nearly seven-year legal battle against Arias.Arias was convicted of murder in 2013 after a lengthy trial that became a sensation with its tawdry revelations about her relationship with victim Travis Alexander.The victim's sister, Samantha Alexander, sobbed in court while the decision was announced.The jurors deliberated for 26.5 hours over a five-day span. Earlier this week, Arias' attorneys said jurors were at an impasse, but the judge denied a mistrial request. A verdict does not rule out the possibility of a hung jury.Arias stabbed and slashed Alexander nearly 30 times, slit his throat so deeply that she nearly decapitated him, and shot him in the forehead. She left his body in his shower at his suburban Phoenix home where friends found him about five days later.She initially denied having anything to do with the killing. She later admitted that she killed Alexander but claimed it was self-defense after he attacked her. Prosecutors said it was premeditated murder carried out in a jealous rage after he wanted to end their affair and planned a trip to Mexico with another woman.That jury deadlocked on her punishment, prompting the sentencing retrial that began in October.Chris Hughes, a friend of Alexander, told KPHO that a hung jury would be frustrating.""My personal opinion is that she earned the death penalty,"" Hughes said. ""I would be OK with life in prison, if she never gets out again, but she deserves the life of a death row inmate.""The day she was convicted of murder, Arias gave a jailhouse interview with a local Fox reporter in which she said she'd rather have the death penalty. ""I believe death is the ultimate freedom,"" she said.The Associated Press contributed to this report","Rewrite the text as a children's story, making it engaging and educational for young readers.","In a faraway land, where the sun shone warm and the trees whispered secrets, there lived a woman named Jodi Arias.

"The Republican Party’s identity crisis keeps getting worse. Hours after House Speaker Paul Ryan said he was not ready to support Donald Trump, the presumptive G.O.P. nominee, 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney also refused to endorse his successor, saying that he was “dismayed” by the state of American politics and that he wished for “better choices” for candidates who, unfortunately, do not exist anymore.While Romney ruled out the possibility of a third-party candidacy during a Q&A at a fundraising gala Thursday night in Washington, he said he was so fundamentally disappointed with the G.O.P. that he could not support Trump in good conscience, nor would he switch allegiances and support Hillary Clinton.“I see way too much demagoguery and populism on both sides of the aisle and I only hope and aspire that we'll see more greatness,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.Earlier this year, Romney championed the Never Trump movement, attempting to block his nomination by proposing the remaining Republican candidates unite to force a contested convention in which an alternative would win the nomination despite winning fewer primaries. That dream ended earlier this week when Ted Cruz dropped out of the race (and John Kasich soon after), but that didn’t stop Romney from sticking to his convictions.“I happen to think that the person who is leading the nation has an enormous and disproportionate impact on the course of the world, so I am dismayed at where we are now,” he said. “I wish we had better choices, and I keep hoping that somehow things will get better, and I just don't see an easy answer from where we are.”Romney also praised Ryan, his former running mate, who recently took on Trump. “He is where he needs to be,” he explained, saying that he was impressed that Ryan could somehow get the wildly fractious House G.O.P. to work together. “I’d love to see him run for president, but having a Speaker of the House, at this stage, where we don’t know what’s going to happen on the presidential race, having a Speaker of the House with that kind of leadership capacity is very encouraging. I have hopes that he’ll remain Speaker.”Romney may not be the first Republican leader to publicly disavow Trump since he became the party’s nominee—that honor goes to Nebraska senator Ben Sasse, who quickly argued that an “adult” step in and run for president on a third-party ticket—but he is by far the most prominent. So far, there have been rumblings within an embarrassed G.O.P. that they could never support Trump: both George H.W. Bush and his son George W. Bush refused to endorse or comment on the nomination, and do not plan on attending the Republican National Convention. Senator John McCain was recorded saying that Trump would severely hurt his re-election chances in Arizona, a Latino-heavy state that borders Mexico. And, as Hillary Clinton highlighted in an e-mail blast, that sentiment isn’t limited to high-profile Republicans, either: dozens of other G.O.P. congressional representatives, governors, and major political figures are all quickly boarding the anti-Trump train—or, at the very least, refusing to comment.",Design a lesson plan for teaching the article's topic in a middle school class.,"The Republican Party's identity crisis continues to worsen, with recent developments highlighting the growing divide within the party.

"President Obama will not endorse a Democratic candidate in the 2016 presidential primary race, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said Sunday.""That's not our job,” McDonough said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “That's the job of the party to make those decisions and then they'll take a look at the agendas and the positions of those candidates.""McDonough said that Obama, in the final 11 months of his presidency, will wait until voters pick a nominee, as he has in the past.“When the nominee will be set, then the president will be out there,"" McDonough said.Obama undoubtedly will back a fellow Democrat -- either front-running Hillary Clinton, Vermont Sen.

Bush didn’t endorse his party’s nominee in 2008 until March 5, by which point Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., had just about locked up the bid.Ronald Reagan didn’t endorse his sitting Vice President, George H. W. Bush, as the Republican nominee until May 1988.

"The 11 service members who were onboard a Black Hawk helicopter that crashed Tuesday night on the Florida panhandle coastline are presumed dead, a Pentagon official said, but a search-and-rescue operation was still underway Wednesday in a desperate search for survivors.Seven Marines and four soldiers were onboard a UH-60 helicopter as part of a training exercise when the chopper ran into heavy fog.

Barry Morris, spokesman for the Marine Corps Special Operations Command at Camp Lejeune.Like the Army's Green Berets and the Navy's SEALs, these Marines were highly skilled unconventional warriors, trained to endure grueling conditions and sensitive assignments on land and at sea, from seizing ships to special reconnaissance missions and direct action inside hostile territory.The helicopter was part of a nighttime training mission Tuesday at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. There was dense fog in the area at the time of the crash but officials have not said what caused the helicopter to go down.Fog had reduced visibility to less than two miles at the time, according to the National Weather Service. Another helicopter participating in the exercise turned back because of the bad weather before the other Black Hawk crashed, authorities said.Despite the human remains washing ashore, the military still called it a rescue mission Wednesday, said Sara Vidoni, a spokeswoman for Eglin Air Force Base, outside Pensacola.The fog remained so heavy Wednesday that search boats just offshore could be heard but not seen, blasting horns as their crews peered into the choppy water. It finally began to lift in the afternoon, enabling a helicopter to slowly survey the water.About a dozen airmen wearing fatigues walked shoulder-to-shoulder down the beach, scanning the sand, while civilian rescue crews and searchers with dogs joined the effort.The Coast Guard said debris was first spotted about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, and that the search area expanded to a 17-mile stretch of the narrow sound separating Santa Rosa Island from the Florida Panhandle mainland.The Marines were part of a special operations group based in Camp Lejeune. They had arrived Sunday for a week of training.None were immediately identified, so that families could be told first.The helicopter that crashed had joined the training from an airport in nearby Destin.

"With only about 70 days left until the election, presidential campaign politics have hit a new low. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has released a new attack ad claiming Republican rival Donald Trump is a candidate of racists.The new ad released by Clinton attempts to depict Trump as a racist, a candidate supported by white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan.In the campaign commercial, a KKK member is heard saying, ""The reason a lot of Klan members like Donald Trump is because a lot of what he believes we believe in.""Clinton said Trump and Republicans are reinforcing harmful stereotypes, calling it a disturbing preview of the kind of president Trump would be.""He is taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party,"" she said.Trump said the allegations are the oldest ploy in the Democratic playbook.""When Democratic policies fail, they are left with only this one, tired argument: 'you're racist, you're racist, you're racist!' Trump insisted.Trump said Clinton was not only attacking him, but millions of good Americans who support him.""She lies, she smears, she paints decent Americans as racists,"" said Trump, who then defended the core ideas of his candidacy.But Clinton isn't backing down. In a speech in the swing state of Nevada, she also tried to tie Trump to the so-called ""AltRight"" or ""alternative right,"" a very vocal group whose nationalist beliefs push beyond mainstream conservatism.""He's taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over one of America's two major political parties,"" she said.Trump's campaign said he's never used the term ""alt-right"" and disavows ""any groups or individuals associated with a message of hate.""""Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society.

"Clinton's campaign, which started raising money for the Democratic National Committee and state Democratic parties this quarter through the Hillary Victory Fund, also raised $18 million in the joint fundraising effort, meaning the campaign raised a total of $55 million for the quarter.In all, the Clinton campaign has raised $112 million for the primary since launching in April. Heading into 2016, the campaign has roughly $38 million cash on hand, according to aides.The haul, which is larger than even some Clinton aides expected, puts a big number on the board that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders -- her main primary challenger -- is unlikely to top.""Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have joined together and powered this historic campaign, we are now heading into Iowa and New Hampshire with the resources we need to be successful,"" Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, said in a statement on Friday.""Helping Democratic candidates win up and down the ticket is a top priority for Hillary Clinton which is why she's also proud to be doing her part to ensure Democrats have the resources we need to win."" CNN reported earlier this week that Clinton raised at least $21 million at fundraisers she personally headlined in the fourth quarter of 2015, a number that almost guaranteed she would break the $100 million goal. The Democratic front-runner headlined a total of 58 fundraisers in the fourth quarter, a pace identical to the 58 events she headlined in the second and third quarters of 2015. The labor-intensive process, which required Clinton to criss-cross the country on both the campaign and fundraising trail, saw the former secretary of state headline fundraisers in 20 states and Washington, D.C. Thirteen events were in New York, the most of any state, and six were in California. The fourth quarter also saw Clinton get more help than usual on the fundraising trail. Former President Bill Clinton headlined dozens of fundraisers in 14 states and Washington, D.C., including events in Texas, Wisconsin and Ohio, during the fourth quarter. While it will be difficult for Sanders to turn in a bigger haul than Clinton, the Vermont senator is expected to bring in a sizable haul, largely buoyed by his strong online contributions. Since launching his campaign, Sanders has solicited over 2.3 million donations and raised over $40 million -- including a sizable $26 million in the third quarter. Aides have said that the campaign is focused on surpassing 1 million donors by the end of the year. Like Clinton, Sanders also signed a joint fundraising effort with the DNC this quarter, starting to raise money for the national party in November.

Five shots hit Strewart, four in the head and one in the lower back.One of Smith's roommates told police that Smith had been contemplating suicide, according to police reports.Stewart had gone to Smith’s girlfriend’s home earlier, but the man who would later kill him was gone. The cop then went to Smith's home, where his roommate said Smith had fled, according to a police report. Records indicate that about an hour later, at 12.30 p.m., Smith called the Flagstaff Police Department and left a message for Stewart, who then went back to Smith’s home where the fatal encounter took place.“This is an enormous tragedy for our department and the family of our officer,” Flagstaff Police Chief Kevin Treadway told AZ Central. “We are a very close-knit organization, and know that all members of the Flagstaff Police Department are grieving at this time.”Release of the frightening footage raises questions about balancing the public's right to know against privacy concerns of police officers and their families, according to Levi Bolton Jr., executive director of the 14,000-member Arizona Police Association. On Wednesday, Bolton met with state lawmakers to discuss the cameras and how best to handle disclosure of footage that may show innocent bystanders, undercover police or informants or, as in Stewart's case, the final moments of an officer's life.""We are currently crafting or looking at legislation that may very well discuss this,"" Bolton told reporters. ""We acknowledge that the public and the media should have access to this information.""A fund to help Stewart's family has been established and those wishing to donate can do so at any Wells Fargo Bank, according to the Flagstaff Police Department. The account number is 7764473984.","Rewrite the article from an alternative perspective, such as from the viewpoint of a person mentioned in the story or from a neutral observer's perspective.","The video captured by Officer Tyler Stewart's body camera that day was a tragedy that not only took the life of a young officer but also left a lasting impact on the community.

"Ed Morrissey is senior editor at HotAir.com, a columnist for The Week and The Fiscal Times, and author of ""Going Red: The Two Million Voters Who Will Elect the Next President -- and How Conservatives Can Win Them."" The views expressed are his own.Traditionally, the spouses of major-party nominees get a speaking slot at the national convention to humanize the candidate. Former presidents speak to remind the faithful of their history. Bill Clinton falls into both categories, but he had a far more difficult task in closing out the second night of the Democratic convention in Philadelphia on Tuesday night; he needed to find a way to knit the party back together again.That's a tall order, and not just because the evening started with a walkout involving hundreds of Bernie Sanders delegates, according to one estimate . A generation has passed since the former president ascended to lead the Democratic Party as the first baby boomer major-party nominee, and then defeated the last of the World War II presidents.Back then, Bill used his enormous natural political talent to fuse the New Left with working class Democrats, while ""triangulating"" on the Republican agenda to carve a centrist path in governance.Twenty-four years later, it's not Bill Clinton's Democratic Party. It might not be Hillary Clinton's Democratic Party. If it hadn't been for the establishment-protecting superdelegates and the Democratic National Convention's efforts to tip the primary scales in her favor, it would likely have been Bernie Sanders' Democratic Party -- and on Tuesday in Philadelphia, with hundreds of empty seats staring back at the stage, it certainly looked as though it was.Twenty-four years later, Bill Clinton isn't the same, youthful physical force, either. At times he seemed frail and at one point a bit distracted. However, Clinton proved that his political instincts haven't dimmed much at all. Rather than take on the task of unifying through direct debate, Clinton delivered a masterful soft-sell by walking through a personal history of his wife that tried to answer the divides in the party.","Reimagine the article as a speculative fiction story, incorporating futuristic elements or technology.","The convention hall pulsed with a symphony of anticipation and unease. The air crackled with the scent of possibility and the ghosts of political battles past. Edged onto the stage, Bill Clinton cast a long shadow across the platform, his voice resonating through the hall.

"The U.S. economy created the fewest number of jobs in more than five years in May, hurt by a strike by Verizon workers and a fall in goods producing employment, pointing to labor market weakness that could make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 38,000 jobs last month, the smallest gain since September 2010, the Labor Department said on Friday. Employers hired 59,000 fewer workers in March and April. The government said the month-long Verizon strike had depressed employment growth by 34,000 jobs.The goods producing sector, which includes mining and manufacturing, shed 36,000 jobs, the most since February 2010. Even without the Verizon strike, payrolls would have increased by a mere 72,000.The Verizon workers, who were considered unemployed because they did not receive a salary during the payrolls survey week, returned to their jobs on Wednesday. They are expected to boost June employment.The jobless rate fell three-tenths of a percentage point to 4.7 percent in May, the lowest since November 2007. The decrease in the unemployment rate was in part due to people dropping out of the labor force.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising 164,000 in May and the unemployment rate falling to 4.9 percent.Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said monthly gains of roughly 100,000 jobs are needed to keep up with growth in the work-age population. The U.S. central bank has signaled its intention to raise rates soon if job gains continued and economic data remained consistent with a pickup in growth in the second quarter.Yellen said last week that a rate increase would probably be appropriate in the ""coming months,"" if those conditions were met. Data on consumer spending, industrial production, goods exports and housing have suggested the economy is gathering speed after growth slowed to a 0.8 percent annualized rate in the first quarter.The Fed hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.There is still no sign of meaningful wage growth. Average hourly earnings rose five cents, or 0.2 percent, last month. That kept the year-on-year rise at 2.5 percent.Economists say wage growth of between 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent is needed to lift inflation to the Fed's 2.0 percent target. There are, however, signs that inflation is creeping higher as the dampening effects of the dollar's past rally and the oil price plunge dissipate.There was little change in other measures of labor market slack. A broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment held steady at 9.7 percent in May.The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell 0.2 percentage point to 62.6 percent.The gains in May were broadly weak, with the private sector adding only 25,000 jobs, the smallest since February 2010. Mining employment maintained its downward trend, shedding 10,000 positions. Mining payrolls have dropped by 207,000 since peaking in September 2014, with three-quarters of the losses in support activities.Manufacturing employment fell by 10,000 jobs. The Verizon labor dispute reduced information sector jobs by 34,000.Retail payrolls rose 11,400 after shedding jobs in April for the first time since December 2014. Temporary help jobs fell 21,000.",Convert into a dialogue between two people with opposing views on the subject.,"**Person 1:**The U.S. economy is creating jobs at a slow pace, but the unemployment rate is still low.

"Ten months after the Supreme Court passed a landmark case on gay marriage, a backlash against the ruling is spreading across the country.Thirty-four states are considering new bills that would protect Christians from the threat of legal action because they object to gay marriage on religious grounds.It's shaping up to be a fierce debate as gay activists and people of faith battle for their rights to be protected.Business owners Dick and Betty Odgaards' story should serve as a warning of what happens when so-called religious freedom laws are not in place to protect people of faith.On August 3, 2013, a gay couple asked the Odgaards if they could rent their gallery in Iowa for a same-sex wedding.""They came in, and Dick was there, and he was the one who had to deliver the bad news to them,"" Betty recalled.The Odgaards refused, citing their Christian belief that marriage should be between one man and one woman.""I don't want to celebrate my sins. I don't want other people to celebrate my sins, nor do I want to participate in celebrating anybody else's sins,"" Richard said.The gay couple sued them for discrimination and after a two-year court battle, rather than celebrate gay marriages, the Christian couple paid the couple a fine and agreed to stop hosting weddings at the gallery.""It has been difficult. I won't lie,"" Betty acknowledged. ""It has been the hardest thing we've ever been through and I don't wish it upon anyone.""Their decision cost them dearly. After months of negative publicity, hate mail, death threats and loss of income, the Gortz Haus Gallery went out of business last year.""The ugly continues to come at us, but I wouldn't want to be anywhere else and we would do it all over again the same way because we are in the middle of God's will,"" Betty told CBN News.Since last summer's Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, more than 100 religious freedom bills have been proposed in 34 states to protect Christians and others from the threat of legal action because they object to gay marriage on religious grounds.Take for example the new law just passed in Mississippi.""The Mississippi law says if you believe marriage is the union of one man and one woman, that sex is reserved for marriage and that we are created male and female -- it doesn't say you have to believe those things -- but it says if you do believe those things, we are not going to penalize you if you act on those beliefs,"" explained Dr. Ryan Anderson, a senior fellow with the Washington, D.C-based Heritage Foundation.In Louisiana and Ohio, lawmakers are also proposing measures that protect pastors who refuse to perform same-sex marriages.Anderson said the accusation that these religious freedom laws are discriminatory against gays and lesbians just isn't true.""I think the basic argument here is that we are trying to protect pluralism, we're trying to protect diversity, we're promoting tolerance,"" he said.But some of the laws have been met with fierce opposition from businesses, activists and celebrities.For instance, North Carolina's governor was forced to roll back portions of a controversial new state law after several companies criticized the law and others threatened to stop their businesses in the state.""I think this just shows you that what's taking place is a form of cronyism, it's cultural cronyism,"" Anderson said. ""Big business is using their marketing freedom to deny little businesses and religious people their religious freedom.""What is clear though is that the backlash from last year's Supreme Court decision has brought religious freedom concerns to the forefront this spring.Many Americans believe that the battle over gay rights versus protecting people's religious convictions is just beginning.",Compose as a list of life lessons learned from the situations described.,The story highlights the potential consequences of laws protecting religious freedom and the ongoing debate surrounding gay rights and religious convictions.**Life lessons learned:*** **Discrimination and its impact:** The story illustrates the harmful effects of discrimination and the impact it can have on individuals and businesses.* **Religious freedom and its limitations:** It
"LAS VEGAS  The Democratic presidential candidates are holding their first debate Tuesday night in Las Vegas.It marks the first time frontrunner Hillary Clinton and her main challenger so far  socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.  will appear on the same stage in this campaign, along with the other three candidates.This campaign was expected to be a cakewalk for the former first lady, but it hasn't turned out that way.One big reason seems to be the story that just won't away: how she used a private email server to conduct government business. It's fed a perception that she can play by a different set of rules.Even so, Clinton still has a decent lead nationally over the socialist senator from Vermont, but Sanders is coming on strong. He's beating her comfortably in the key state of New Hampshire and is close in Iowa, too.Plus, Sanders is the one drawing tens of thousands of people to his events. Democratic voters seem to be listening intently to his populist messages.With the threat from Sanders a reality, Clinton is now trying to reposition herself a little more leftward. Just recently she came out against President Barack Obama's big Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement.That's a reversal because while serving as secretary of state, she was for it. This new position puts her more in line with the liberal base of her party.""As of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it,"" Clinton said. ""I don't believe it's going to meet the high bar I have set.""So, tonight the drama will center on how much Sen. Sanders and the other Democrats confront Clinton directly on the debate stage.Expect former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley to be an instigator. He's trying to get traction and has taken some shots at Clinton over the last few months.As for Clinton herself, she's trying to avoid a repeat of 2008 when she went in as the heavy favorite, then ran into a buzz saw called Barack Obama.This time around the buzz is growing for Bernie Sanders.","Reimagine the article as a speculative fiction story, incorporating futuristic elements or technology.","The Democratic presidential candidates are holding their first debate Tuesday night in the neon glow of Las Vegas.

"That was President Barack Obama's message to American consumers on Tuesday as he discussed near six year-low gas prices in an interview with The Detroit News ahead of a visit to Michigan on Wednesday to tout the recovery of the auto industry and the growth of American manufacturing.""I would strongly advise American consumers to continue to think about how you save money at the pump because it is good for the environment, it's good for family pocketbooks and if you go back to old habits and suddenly gas is back at $3.50, you are going to not be real happy,"" Obama said.But instead of returning to ""old habits,"" Obama advised Americans to save their money, ""or better yet"" use the savings to buy a new car, for example.He said Americans should ""not believe that"" gas prices won't rise again, explaining that demand for oil in booming countries like China and India will continue to rise, kicking costs back up. Oil prices have dropped more than 50% in recent months, falling below $50 a barrel for the first time since 2009 on Monday. Many members of Congress are counting on gas prices to remain low, however, as they hope to use the low prices as an opportunity to increase the gas tax for the first time in more than two decades. As he touts the results of his bailout of the auto industry on Wednesday, Obama will also promote fuel efficiency at the Ford plant he is set to visit, which produces alternative fuel vehicles and small cars, The News reported. Obama gave the newspaper a preview of his speech Wednesday, in which he is expected to tout the resurgence of the auto industry and the boom of American manufacturing -- two key points of his plan for economic recovery, and elements he hopes will become a part of his legacy as president. ""The auto industry has led a resurgence of manufacturing in America,"" Obama said.

"In a marketing fiasco that could rank right up there with “New Coke,” Starbucks has ditched its plan to have baristas ignite a national discussion on race after critics advised the chain its view of black and white should revolve around coffee and milk.The baristas had begun writing ""Race Together"" on customers' cups, as a means of starting a conversation with customers, but the practice ended Sunday after just one week, said company spokesman Jim Olson. But the chain's initiative will continue more broadly without the handwritten messages, Starbucks spokesman Jim Olson said.The cups were always ""just the catalyst"" for a larger conversation and Starbucks will still hold forum discussions, co-produce special sections in USA Today and put more stores in minority communities as part of the Race Together initiative, according to a company memo from CEO Howard Schultz said.The campaign has been criticized as opportunistic and inappropriate, coming in the wake of racially charged events such as national protests over police killings of black males. Others questioned whether Starbucks workers could spark productive conversations about race while serving drinks.The critics blasted Corey duBrowa, the company's senior vice president of global communications, on Twitter after the plan was first announced, calling it patronizing at best and inflammatory at worst. The executive was forced to delete his Twitter account, although he re-activated it the next day.“Last night I felt personally attacked in a cascade of negativity,” he tweeted. “I got overwhelmed by the volume and tenor of the discussion, and I reacted.”The phase-out is not a reaction to that pushback, Olson said.

With the subreddit set to private, the note adds that “You must be a moderator or approved submitter to visit.” Visitors to the subreddit were also urged to continue their discussions on Voat, another online forum.The question of bias in social media has erupted recently. The Reddit accusation came just days after anonymous allegations that contractors at Facebook deliberately suppressed conservative news on the site’s Trending Topics section. Facebook has denied any political bias, saying there is “no evidence” of the alleged activity.Reddit told FoxNews.com that the 'european' subreddit violated the forum's content policy.

"Donald Trump is surging in new battleground and national polls at a time when Hillary Clinton faces tough questions not only about her health but her sweeping criticism of her Republican opponent’s supporters.Several surveys appear to show the Republican presidential nominee effectively ending, at least for now, a post-convention slump that saw Clinton leading in virtually every swing state. Now, a Monmouth University Poll shows Trump taking a narrow 2-point lead in Nevada; a Bloomberg Politics poll shows Trump leading Clinton by 5 points in Ohio; and new CNN/ORC polls show Trump leading in Florida and Ohio.In the latter survey, Trump leads 46-41 percent among likely voters in Ohio, and 47-44 percent among likely voters in Florida.“We’ve really had a good month,” Trump told Fox News’ “Fox & Friends,” claiming he’s enjoying renewed “enthusiasm” from voters.Clinton, though, plans to return to the campaign trail Thursday afternoon after taking three days off to recover from a bout of pneumonia. While her campaign dispatched high-powered surrogates to the stump in her absence -- including Bill Clinton and President Obama -- the Democratic nominee’s presence could help reset the race once again.The contest remains tight, and the polls are hardly uniform. A Quinnipiac University national poll released Wednesday showed Clinton leading 48-43 percent among likely voters.But that still represents a narrowing of the race since a late-August survey showing Clinton up 10 points.The recent surveys come as Clinton grapples with new controversies on two fronts: Her comment at a Friday fundraiser that half of Trump’s backers are in a “basket of deplorables,” and her campaign’s handling of a health scare on Sunday during a 15th anniversary ceremony honoring victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.Clinton has since expressed regret for her “deplorables” comment, though Trump has called on her to outright retract it. And Clinton’s campaign has sought to answer questions about the former secretary of state's health, after Clinton was seen stumbling at the 9/11 memorial event in New York City.The campaign said she was overheated and dehydrated, and revealed she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. While the incident revived long-simmering questions about her health, the campaign on Wednesday released additional medical details. Dr. Lisa Bardack, Clinton’s physician, said she is “recovering well with antibiotics and rest.”Bardack also said Clinton remains “healthy and fit to serve.”Trump, too, has tried to answer questions about his own health. He discussed the results of a recent physical with TV’s “Dr. Oz,” and told Fox News on Thursday “they were good.” The discussion with “Dr. Oz” will air on his show Thursday.Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign maintains they always knew states like Ohio would be competitive – and they are building out their operation there.The campaign announced that they will open a half-dozen new offices in the state, bringing their total to 54.",Formulate as an inspiring speech for high school students.,"The recent surge in Donald Trump's poll numbers and the challenges facing Hillary Clinton have undoubtedly sparked a renewed sense of excitement in the presidential race.

"WASHINGTON -- Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) introduced legislation Wednesday to authorize military force against Islamic State militants -- a step aimed at forcing Congress to take responsibility for a war it's been funding for nearly six months with almost no debate on its duration, costs or potential toll.Lawmakers have put no parameters on the U.S. military campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, since it began in August. Since then, the U.S. has spent more than $1 billion, participated in more than 1,700 airstrikes, and authorized sending roughly 3,000 U.S. troops to Iraq. All of this has happened without new war authorization.Schiff's proposed Authorization for the Use of Military Force would do three things: limit military action against ISIS to three years; prohibit the use of U.S. ground troops; and immediately terminate a still-active 2002 AUMF tied to the Iraq War. It also would end, in three years, a sweeping 2001 AUMF that President Barack Obama says gives him the authority to go after ISIS without new war authorization. Some in Congress disagree that Obama has that authority and insist he needs new authorization, which the president says he would welcome.""There is no doubt that our current offensive amounts to war,"" said Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. ""Congress should take action both to authorize its prosecution and to set limits on that authorization so it may not be used by any future administration in a manner contrary to our intent.""Schiff is a lonely voice in the House. Even progressives, like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), have treated the need for new war authorization as an afterthought. It's not much better in the Senate, where Democrats hastily passed an AUMF out of a committee in late December, knowing it was going nowhere. They did so to show their frustration over the lack of attention to the issue.If the new Congress has revealed anything, it's that nobody in Washington wants to go first when it comes to authorizing a war. The White House typically submits draft AUMF language to Congress as a first step to moving a bill, but administration officials say they want feedback from Capitol Hill before moving. Lawmakers, meanwhile, are grumbling about waiting for draft language from Obama when they could be moving forward with legislation on their own.""There is plenty of responsibility to go around,"" Schiff told The Huffington Post. ""I place more responsibility here than at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. They don't have to make the first step. There is nothing holding us back except political timidity.""For now, Schiff is on the lookout for co-sponsors for his bill. He doesn't have any yet, but he said he plans to reach out to lawmakers in both parties. Nobody in the Senate has introduced AUMF legislation, though Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), a vocal proponent for passing new war authorization, has called for using last year's committee-passed bill as the base for new legislation in this Congress.Schiff acknowledged that his proposal is probably more narrow than the White House wants, and that Obama will likely look to Republicans to give him broad authority. Secretary of State John Kerry told senators in December that the administration would oppose an AUMF that explicitly prohibits U.S. ground troops, which some Democrats have insisted on. Republicans appeared more amenable to Kerry's request.""Many of us are skeptical of another broad AUMF considering what's happened with the last one,"" Schiff said. ""There will be some interesting bedfellows on this.""","Reframe the text as a policy proposal or white paper, providing solutions to problems discussed.","**The ongoing U.S. military campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, known as ISIS, has raised concerns about the lack of a formal war authorization.

"That may soon be possible thanks to a provision tacked onto this year's National Defense Authorization Act, which the House of Representatives is set to pass this week.The provision was added as an amendment during a late-night session at the end of last month during which the legislation authorizing the nation's military activities for 2016 was drafted.According to a white paper prepared for Congress by the Army opposing the amendment, the measure would allow the unregulated distribution of up to 100,000 Colt .45s, more formally known as .45-caliber semiautomatic M1911 handguns.The provision, added by Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.), changes parts of federal rules that were meant to boost rifle skills in the country under a program dating back to Teddy Roosevelt. Under existing law, which was updated in 1996, the Department of Defense makes surplus military rifles available to the public through something known as the Civilian Marksmanship Program, which has a regional headquarters in Rogers' state.Rogers' amendment would change language in the law that specifies certain rifles allowed in the program to include the much broader category of ""firearms.""Although the marksmanship program aims to educate youth about safety and shooting, according to the military's white paper, ""There is a significant risk of approximately 100K semi-automatic handguns that are virtually untraceable, being released into commerce.""That's because although the amendment specifies that the weapons cannot be sold to people who are barred by law from having guns, the CMP sells guns over the Internet, and has no mechanism to verify who is making purchases. By law, the CMP ""can sell ... only to members of CMP affiliated clubs who are also U.S. citizens, over 18 years of age and who are legally eligible to purchase a firearm,"" according to eligibility requirements posted on its website. On top of that, although the CMP is allowed by law to sell guns across state lines, it is not covered by the Gun Control Act, and is not required to keep records tracking purchasers.The Army noted in its opposition that the Department of Justice has tracked an average of nearly 1,800 Colt .45s being used in crimes every year over the last decade, including a significant but unspecified number of those guns that were originally military surplus.A spokesman for Rep. Adam Smith (Wash.), the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said his boss agreed with the Army and would try to strip the amendment.""This provision, which the Army has said it does not want or need, could potentially put nearly 100,000 untraceable .45-caliber military-grade handguns on our streets,"" the spokesman, Michael Amato, said in an email. ""This provision is an unnecessary risk.""","Compose the article as a debate, presenting opposing viewpoints on the issues discussed.","The proposed legislation authorizing the distribution of up to 100,000 Colt .45s raises concerns about the potential for increased gun violence.

"Many Republicans claim that President Obama is among the most polarizing presidents in modern history. If the results of a new Gallup survey measuring his approval rating are any indication, they might be right.The president's overall approval rating for his just finished sixth year in office stood at 42.6 percent, according to Gallup. That's well below Bill Clinton's or Ronald Reagan's sixth-year average (63.8 percent and 59.9 percent, respectively). Even so, Obama's average for the year is still ahead of Richard Nixon (25.4 percent), who was by this point in his presidency mired in Watergate; George W. Bush (37.3 percent); or Harry S. Truman (38.6 percent).But another measure that looks at how Republicans and Democrats view presidential performance shows that Obama is on track to be the most polarizing president ever, nudging out his predecessor with an average 70-point gap between the political parties.""Both Bush and Obama were elected with hopes of unifying the country. However, the opposite has happened, at least in the way Americans view the job the president is doing, with presidential evaluations more divided along party lines than ever before, Gallup notes.""These increasingly partisan views of presidents may have as much to do with the environment in which these presidents have governed as with their policies, given 24-hour news coverage of what they do and increasingly partisan news and opinion sources on television, in print and online,"" the polling organization says.In his sixth year in office, 79 percent of Democrats approve of Obama's performance, while just 9 percent of Republicans do. George W. Bush's numbers were exactly reversed in year six of his presidency (79 percent of Republicans approval vs. 9 percent for Democrats).Obama and Bush had their most polarized approval ratings in their fourth years in office, both with a 76 percentage point gap between Republicans and Democrats for the final year of their first term (although Bush had slightly higher approval from both parties, the gap was still the same). As Gallup points out, the fourth year is typically the most polarized in a president's due to it being an election year.According to Gallup: ""Each of Obama's six years in office rank among the 10 most polarized in the last 60 years, with George W. Bush holding the other four spots. Bush's most polarized years were his fourth through seventh years in office, after the rally in support for him following the 9/11 terror attacks had faded. Clearly, political polarization has reached new heights in recent years, under a Republican and a Democratic president.""","Convert the article into a fitness workout, with exercises themed around the story or its characters.","**Obama vs. Bush Fitness Workout****Warm-up (5 minutes)*** Light cardio, such as walking or jogging* Dynamic stretching, such as leg swings and arm circles**Main exercises (30 minutes)****1.

"He's combative. He rejects compromise as ""the mushy middle."" He's not inclined to wait his turn. And he doesn't seem to mind annoying his Republican elders with tactics that critics see as destructive and short-sighted.So perhaps it's no surprise that little more than two years after he was sworn in to the Senate, the 44-year-old Texan on Monday became the first contender to officially announce his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. He skipped the one-step-at-a-time tradition of announcing an ""exploratory"" committee to declare flatly that he was in the race.""It's going to take a new generation of courageous conservatives to help make America great again,"" Cruz said in a 30-second video he posted on Twitter early Monday morning, followed by a speech at Liberty University, ""and I'm ready to stand with you to lead the fight.""He won't be lonely for long. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is slated to announce his candidacy in two weeks, likely followed in short order by yet another Republican senator, Marco Rubio of Florida. That's not to mention the governors (Wisconsin's Scott Walker, New Jersey's Chris Christie, Louisiana's Bobby Jindal), the former governors (Florida's Jeb Bush, Texas' Rick Perry, Arkansas' Mike Huckabee), the former senators (Pennsylvania's Rick Santorum) and the others who already are visiting Iowa and New Hampshire and hiring staffers for nascent campaigns.At his speech, a handful of students in a prominent front row sported red ""Stand With Rand"" sweatshirts.Cruz has been overshadowed in recent months by Bush, Walker and other contenders who have more muscular fundraising networks and stronger institutional support. In the Senate, he has been more of an agitator than a legislator. Arizona Sen. John McCain, the GOP's 2008 nominee, once called him a ""wacko bird.""That said, Cruz is worth watching.For one thing, the skills he honed as a college debater at Princeton — he was named U.S. National Speaker of the Year in 1992 — should serve him well in the series of crowded primary debates.For another, while his Tea Party credentials might be a mixed blessing in a general election, in the primaries they align him with the most energized forces in the Republican grass roots today. That helped him upset the establishment's favorite, lieutenant governor David Dewhurst, for the Republican Senate nomination in 2012.What's more, the locale Cruz chose to make Monday's announcement reflects his efforts to broaden his electoral base by wooing Christian conservatives, another key group in the GOP coalition. He spoke at the Lynchburg, Va., school founded by evangelical leader Jerry Falwell that describes itself on its website as the largest Christian university in the world.His speech had the ring of the religious testimony of an evangelical church. He declared his opposition to abortion and his support of traditional marriage. He emotionally described how his father's embrace of Jesus saved his parents' marriage. His father, Rafael, a pastor at a suburban Dallas church, fled Castro's Cuba in 1957.Cruz's Cuban-American heritage would be a selling point for the Republican Party as it tries to reach out to Hispanic voters, although his hardline stance on immigration could be a complication with those voters. And speaking of biography, he has an education that might surprise those inclined to dismiss him: He was graduated from Princeton and then from Harvard Law School, magna cum laude, before clerking at the Supreme Court for Chief Justice William Rehnquist.At one point, he urged his audience to ""take out your cellphones"" and text the word ""Constitution"" or ""Liberty"" — ""we're flexible,"" he said — to a number linked to his campaign.","Rewrite the text as a series of tweets, capturing the essence of the story in short messages.","**Tweet 1:**""Meet the 1st Republican presidential contender for 2016, Texas Sen. @Cruz.

"Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon said he will vote to support the Iran nuclear deal, a pledge that puts President Barack Obama only three votes short of protecting the pact in Congress.Merkley issued a statement Sunday calling the accord “the best available strategy to block Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.”Merkley’s support brings to 31 the number of senators publicly favoring the deal, which would ease economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on the country’s nuclear program.Barring defections, Obama needs three more votes from 13 Senate Democrats who have yet to declare their position, to sustain a likely veto of legislation aimed at killing the pact.If Obama can assemble 41 Senate votes by getting most of the remaining Democrats on board, the Senate may not vote on the agreement at all.The Republican-controlled Congress has until Sept. 17 to pass a resolution disapproving the deal reached in July between six world powers and Iran. Obama has pledged to veto that resolution if it gets to his desk.While Republicans have been united in opposing the deal, only two Democratic senators -- Charles Schumer of New York, the third-ranking Democrat in the chamber, and Robert Menendez of New Jersey -- have joined them so far.Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, plans to announce his decision on Tuesday. Among other Democrats yet to disclose a position are Maryland’s Ben Cardin and New Jersey’s Cory Booker.The only uncertain Senate Republican vote is that of Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who remains undecided and is expected to make her decision after Sept. 7.Merkley, in a statement on his website, pledged to vote for the deal even while pointing to “significant shortcomings” that he said the U.S. must address with “a massive intelligence program” and monitoring.Merkley said he was troubled that the deal allows Iran to import conventional arms after five years and ballistic missile technology after eight years, and sets no restrictions on how Iran can use money it reclaims when sanctions are lifted.But he rejected a proposal from deal opponents to try to renegotiate the accord for better terms.If the U.S. rejects the deal and Iran resumes its nuclear program, “the United States would be viewed by the international community as undermining a strong framework for peacefully blocking a potential Iranian bomb,” Merkley said.While the Republican-controlled House has enough votes to pass a resolution rejecting the deal, it’s unclear whether the Senate does. Assuming all 54 Senate Republicans oppose the accord, they would need support from six Democrats to get the 60 votes necessary to advance a resolution.",Present the information as a series of Instagram-style photo captions.,"**Photo 1:**""Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon has pledged to vote for the Iran nuclear deal, bringing the total number of senators supporting the pact to 31.
